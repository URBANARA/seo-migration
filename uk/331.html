<div>Our range of bedding sets includes bed linen, quilts, bed sheets and duvets. All bed linen collections feature a
    duvet cover, pillowcase and fitted sheet and come in a variety of sizes, including single, double and king-size.
    Whatever style you prefer whether it be timeless classic white bed linen, bold striking colours to elegant
    embroidered bedding, our collection contains something for all. Choose fitted or flat sheets made in durable linen,
    breathable cotton, soft flannel or elegant silk. For more information the the types of fibres we use in the
    production of our materials, please see our buying guide.&nbsp;</div>

<div>Our duvets are available in several thicknesses. To help you decide which thickness of duvet to buy we use the UK
    tog rating system. The higher the rating, the warmer the duvet is, ensuring it will be a great choice for winter.
    The lower the rating, the lighter the duvet, meaning it is an excellent choice for summer. We also have numerous
    quilt and bedspread collections which are an easy way to inject a splash of colour into your bedroom whilst also
    serving the practical purpose of adding an extra layer to your bed or doubling as a throw for a sofa or other
    furniture.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Kids&rsquo; bedding sets also feature with our children&rsquo;s bed linen collection which is made from
    high-quality breathable cotton or super-soft flannel ensuring your child&rsquo;s bed is ultra cosy and warm. Many of
    our children&rsquo;s bedding collections are made according to stringent certification standards. For more
