<div>Our range of duvet covers, made from silk, cotton or linen will bring elegance and comfort to any bedroom. For
    those who prefer simple designs or a laidback look, our 100% mercerised cotton or linen duvet collections are the
    perfect solution with simple breathable fibres that enable you to sleep in comfort without forsaking style. All of
    our cotton duvet covers are made with a high thread count and long staple cotton ensuring that they are long-lasting
    and of excellent quality. For more information on thread count, please see our buying guide. For those who like the
    opulence of silk, we have a range of silk duvet covers that bring a real sense of luxury to any bedroom. As silk is
    also naturally hypoallergenic, it is resistant to mould and mildew and so keeps dust mites away - making it the
    perfect material for anyone with sensitive skin or allergies. </div>

<div>Our duvet covers are available in single, double and king-size and come with matching pillowcases. Combine with one
    of our fitted sheets and mattress protectors to help you on your way to an excellent night’s sleep. Our
    children’s bed linen collection also features super-soft duvet covers, to help your little ones get a restful
    night’s sleep. For detailed washing instructions, check the label of each product. However with most of our
    duvet covers, except for those made of silk, we recommend washing them inside out and with similar colours at
    40°C. If your washing machine has a spin speed setting this should be set at low.</div>
