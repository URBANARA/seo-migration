  <h2>Hammam Towels</h2>
  <p>Whether for the bathroom, spa, pool, or beach, hammam towels deliver an unmatched number of benefits including
      style, comfort and versatility. Crafted from feather-light, absorbent cotton, and available in a wide range of
      delightful motifs and colours, hammam towels bring a sophisticated functionality to any home. Easily packed away,
      they make the dream towel for travel or outings to the beach, pool, sauna and gym. Their enduring popularity is
      clear from their long history. In the spas, baths and saunas of the East, they have long been used as body wraps,
      and to dry off after a session in the steam.</p>
  <h2>Hammam Towels &ndash; What are they?</h2>
  <p>Fashioned from flat-woven cotton, these towels display some highly desirable characteristics and benefits. Designed
      for the high humidity of Turkish baths, they are extremely absorbent. They&rsquo;re also very fast drying compared
      to regular terry cloth towels. Meanwhile, they&rsquo;re refreshingly lightweight. In fact, they can weigh as
      little as one third as ordinary towels. This makes them ideal travel accessories.</p>
  <h2>Hammam Towels &ndash; Where are they originally from?</h2>
  <p>These towels derive their evocative name from the traditional Turkish Baths known as hammam, a phrase which means
      &ldquo;spreader of warmth&rdquo;. In fact these lovely cotton towels boast an even longer history as they were
      once used in the bathhouses of ancient Rome. Also known as Peshtemal towels, these gorgeous items are woven by
      hand on traditional looms by skilled artisans. Measuring a generous 90/95cm by 180cm, they&rsquo;re ideal for both
      covering the body and absorbing water. Though now quintessentially Turkish, the art of making these towels was
      adopted and refined by other cultures around the Mediterranean. Examples are countries such as Tunisia and Algeria
      where they are known as Fouta towels.</p>
  <h2>Hammam Towels &ndash; What are they used for?</h2>
  <h3>Hammam Towels &ndash; Perfect for spa bathing and wellness</h3>
  <p>Their style, sumptuous softness and durability makes them the perfect spa towels for use in high end resorts and
      wellness centres. With a heritage in the steam rooms of the Ottoman Empire, they have the strength and style to be
      the ideal sauna towel. Another key factor is that the flat weave results in fewer allergens being trapped in the
      fibre. So much so, that they are often also known as spa towels or wellness towels.</p>
  <h3>Hammam Towels &ndash; Perfect on the beach</h3>
  <p>Lightweight and quick drying, the hammam towel makes the holiday and travel accessory par excellence. Compared to
      standard terry-weave towels, these items are far less bulky and easy to pack away for a day at the beach or a
      longer holiday. They&rsquo;re ideal for boat trips for a day out on the lake or an epic voyage on an ocean liner,
      along with picnics and other days out in the country or bathing at the seaside. Another benefit is that a hammam
      beach towel can be worn wrapped as a sarong, scarf, throw or wrap, a bed or soft blanket, soft beach seating, as
      well as an absorbent towel.</p>
  <h3>Hammam Towels &ndash; Perfect for the active lifestyle</h3>
  <p>Its lightness and absorbency makes the hammam towel the ideal accessory for the exercise buff, yoga practitioner,
      or Pilate&#39;s enthusiast. It can serve as a gym towel, yoga mat cover, or just for a rub down after a vigorous
      workout</p>
  <h3>Hammam Towels &ndash; For a touch of Ottoman splendour in the home or bathroom</h3>
  <p>After millennia of use, Hammam towels are still desirable today in many homes and bathrooms owing to their timeless
      style. They come in a range of rich and vibrant colours such as red, blue, lilac, beige and orange. They look
      especially good in subtle colours such as cream and charcoal where they exhibit a refined sense of beauty.</p>
  <p>Another feature of the flat-woven cloth is that it permits elaborate patterns to be incorporated into the fabric.
      Also, many models feature delightful embellishments such as tassels and fringed edges.</p>
  <p>Many a savvy homemaker has adopted one of these hammam towels in the UK to create coverings and wall hangings that
      bring a soft and subtle elegance to any room.</p>
  <h2>Hammam Towels &ndash; How to wash them</h2>
  <p>Sturdily woven from quality fibres, hammam towels will deliver years of service. Before use, owners should soak the
      towels in cold water overnight and then give a first machine wash and dry. Fabric softeners are not needed. In
      fact, one benefit of these towels is that they&rsquo;ll naturally become softer and suppler over time.</p>
