  "Quilts have been perennial favourite over many generations. Quilts can bring a classic country style to life.
      Some modern cut quilts will give a bedroom the opposite effect. Either way, a quilt from URBANARA will be a warm,
      stylish addition to any bedroom. Match colours and patterns in a quilt with your bedroom colour scheme to create a
      well-balanced look. Use <u>bed linen</u> such as <u>bed sheets</u> and <u>blankets</u> to intensify or highlight
      the patterns of your <u>quilt</u>. Use ruffled <u>cushions</u> and a matching quilt for comfort and feminising a
      girl’s room. An earth toned <u>cashmere</u> blanket will create a luxurious, yet masculine touch to a
      youth’s bedroom. You can find more ideas for bedroom designs by browsing the URBANARA website. We specialize
      in bedroom, bath and dining room linens.

  Bedspreads set the tone and style of a bedroom. Bedspread designs create a focal point for the eyes. Colours and
      patterns on bedspreads are creatively used to create visual effects such as perceived space and light. By matching
      bed sheets, blankets and bed linens to your bedspread, you can turn your drab bedroom into a stylish boudoir.
      <u>Cashmere blankets</u> layered under your bedspread can add cosy warmth to those chilly winter nights. Extend
      your bedroom designing into an adjoining bathroom with <u>bath mats</u> and matching <u>towel</u> sets. Top it all
      off with a classy <u>dressing gown</u>. Search through the URBANARA website for additional bedspread and bedroom
      designing ideas."
