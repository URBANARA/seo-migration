   <h2>Summer Duvets</h2>

   <h2>What is a summer duvet and which weight should you buy?</h2>

  <p>Everyone knows the importance of a good night's sleep. In particular,
    if you get too hot or too cold during the night, it can lead to feelings
    of tiredness in the morning. That's why it makes sense to change duvets
    according to the season, opting for a heavier one to ward off the winter
    chill and a lighter one for the balmy months of summer. Made to high standards
    from high-quality materials, URBANARA's summer duvets come in a range of
    sizes (single, double and king size) and fillings, from airy cotton to
    sumptuous goose down.</p>
   <h2>Summer duvets vs. Winter duvets – how they differ</h2>

  <p>Summer and winter duvets differ mainly in the density and thickness of
    their filling. As well as providing excellent thermal insulation, the heaviness
    of a winter duvet enables it to wrap itself around the sleeper's body in
    a snug layer. A summer duvet has a less substantial filling which results
    in a fluffier, feather-light feeling, but our finely crafted duvets still
    deliver a special sensation of comfort and cosiness.</p>
   <h2>Summer duvet tog ratings explained: Which tog duvet to buy</h2>

  <p>A tog is a measurement of thermal insulation. Most duvets come with a
    tog rating which indicates how warm they will be. The higher the tog rating,
    the warmer the duvet, although it is worth remembering that it will be
    warmer still by the time the buyer adds an outer cover. Tog ratings run
    from a refreshing 4 through to a toasty 15, with the ideal summer tog rating
    being a question of taste and circumstance.</p>
   <h3>Tog rating - 4 and 4.5</h3>

  <p>Duvets with a 4 or 4.5 rating are the perfect choice for people who like
    to stay cool during warm summer nights. They're especially appropriate
    for bedrooms without air conditioning or muggy city apartments.</p>
   <h3>Tog rating - 8</h3>

  <p>A duvet with a tog rating of 8 offers a cosiness factor, while still being
    light enough for the warmer months of the year. It's a good selection for
    those living in chilly older properties or areas where the summers stay
    mild and temperate.</p>
   <h3>Tog rating - 12</h3>

  <p>While it can still be used in the summer, a duvet rated 12 is probably
    better suited to spring or autumn when temperatures can rise or drop unexpectedly.
    It's a sound option for customers who really feel the cold and prefer to
    err on the side of caution.</p>
   <h2>Which duvet size to choose</h2>

  <p>URBANARA duvets are available in three standard sizes, single (135 x 200
    cm), double (200 x 200 cm) and king-size (225 x 220 cm). For a lavishly
    draped, visually appealing look, it's a good idea to choose a summer duvet
    that exceeds the measurements of the bed by at least a fifth. This also
    allows a little extra elbow room for the bed's occupants and ensures that
    there is plenty of fabric to go round.</p>
   <h2>Summer duvets: what materials can they be made from?</h2>

  <p>Duvets can be made from natural fillings such as cotton, down and feathers
    or synthetic fillings like hollow fibre and microfibre. Natural fillings
    can't be beaten in terms of softness and thermal insulation; however, they
    may not be an option for sufferers of allergies. In that case, man-made
    materials offer a great alternative. Besides being hypoallergenic, these
    synthetic duvets are easy to wash and dry on a regular basis, a process
    which helps to kill allergy-inducing dust mites.</p>
   <h3>Feather filled duvets for summer and winter</h3>

  <p>Feathers belong to a bird's tough outer covering and are distinguished
    by the stiff quill than runs down their middle. Smaller, fine feathers
    are preferred as larger ones can snap inside the duvet, creating prickly
    edges that become an irritant. While duck feathers are slightly heavier
    than those of geese and the down clusters are smaller, they still offer
    outstanding comfort and warmth.</p>
   <h3>Down quilts</h3>

  <p>Down comes from the softer parts of the bird such as the chest and underbelly.
    A piece of down has a tiny core called a plumule surrounded by delicate,
    silky fibres. Because down is an extremely efficient insulator, a summer
    duvet with a down filling can feel much lighter to the touch than the alternatives.
    Many of the most finely crafted duvets feature a blend of both down and
    feathers to create a satisfying combination of fluffiness and weight. Goose
    down is prized as an insulator because its large, snowflake-like clusters
    of fibres excel at trapping warm air. Duvets with a goose down filling
    are light and soft, giving a luxurious, high end feeling. Canadian goose
    down and European goose down both deliver exceptional performance.</p>
   <h3>Cotton-filled duvets for sensitive skin</h3>

  <p>Smooth, breathable and easy to maintain, cotton is the natural filling
    of choice for allergy sufferers and those with sensitive skin. The URBANARA
    Koper cotton duvet is perfect for the warmer months given that it acts
    as a natural temperature regulator while remaining breathable.</p>
   <h3>Mircofibre duvets for allergy sufferers</h3>

  <p>A fifth of the width of a strand of human hair, polyester microfibre efficiently
    traps warm air, while its hypoallergenic properties actively ensure a good
    night's sleep for those with asthma and similar complaints. The Karp mircofibre
    duvet by URBANARA is therefore the perfect choice for those suffering with
    allergies or sensitive skin, while it remains as soft and comfortable as
    you could wish for.</p>
   <h2>Summer duvets – URBANARA standards and certifications</h2>

  <p>When buying a summer duvet, it's well worth noting what industry standards
    it complies with. An OEKO-TEX certification indicates that a product is
    environmentally responsible and that it is a healthy addition to the home.
    The NOMITE standard checks for chemicals that can cause discomfort for
    customers prone to allergies. Meanwhile, a Traumpass stamp indicates that
    a duvet uses only class I and II down, and a Daunacara logo signifies densely
    packed down that prevents the spread of dust mites.</p>
