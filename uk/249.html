   <h2>Curtains</h2>

   <h2>Beautiful curtains for a modern lifestyle</h2>

  <p>Much more than mere strips of cloth, curtains are important home accessories
    that play a central role in the form and function of a room.</p>
  <p>In terms of form they can confer a sense of harmony or act as a stunning
    focal point. Functionally, they keep out noise, cold and prying eyes, and
    play an important part in the light levels in a room when combined with
    lamps and other lighting. This includes protecting carpet and furniture
    from damaging UV light.</p>
  <p>Curtains also allow for fast and easy makeovers. Installing new curtains
    can quickly revive a drab space or revamp the mood and feel of a room.

    and livability.</p>
   <h2>Which curtains to choose</h2>

  <p>When deciding on which curtains to choose, it’s first necessary to consider
    their intended use. This allows informed choices regarding materials, fabric
    density, style, and colour. Other important factors include the decor and
    lighting in the room.</p>
   <h3>Materials used for URBANARA curtains</h3>

  <p>URBANARA offers an elegant range of designs, which include cotton curtains,
    as well as those made from linen, velvet, and other blends. Each of these
    lovely materials has its own special qualities, offering homeowners a rich
    and flexible choice. Product lines are continually updated as our buyers
    unearth new items, trends and styles.</p>
  <p>Organic cotton can be woven finely to create sheer curtains or voiles
    that deliver a warm soft light. Available in solid colours and subtle or
    bold patterns, cotton curtains look especially good with a jacquard weave,
    which gives the fabric a nice drape and helps the panels to break beautifully
    on the floor.</p>
  <p>URBANARA’s linen curtains are made exclusively from high-quality flax
    for a natural, textured effect: depending on the thickness of the fabric,
    linen curtains can be either semi-transparent, allowing some light to filter
    through but still retaining privacy, or opaque – meaning less light filters
    through. Linen curtains are also offered with stylish fringed edges.</p>
  <p>Linen curtains are especially practical because of the fabric’s natural
    anti-static qualities, so it won’t attract dust. They are therefore excellent
    curtains for allergy sufferers.</p>
  <p>Crafted from pure cotton, velvet’s dense pile results in a smooth and
    silky feel along with considerable opacity and heat insulation. Style-wise,
    the rich texture of velvet curtains creates a timeless sense of drama in
    any setting. Moreover, like linen, velvet drapes beautifully.</p>
   <h3>Curtain fabric density</h3>

  <p>Curtain fabric density determines how much heat, light and sound passes
    through the material and thus its qualities. Pay attention to the fabric
    used to make the curtains, for example, a plain cotton curtain may have
    a different fabric density to velvet curtains.</p>
  <p>Sheer curtains, usually made from cotton, feature the least density and
    thus the most transparency. This breezy style is perfect for the daytime
    when homeowners seek both illumination and privacy. It’s also a good way
    to keep out UV light which can cause carpets and upholstery to fade.</p>
  <p>At the other end of the spectrum are blackout curtains. Fashioned from
    heavy linen/cotton blends or velvet, and often with a backing, these are
    perfect for use in bedrooms. Other than ensuring complete darkness, they
    also muffle sound and create a cosy cocoon affect for sleeping in at the
    weekends.</p>
  <p>A compromise is available in the form of mid-weight fabrics such as linen
    curtains.</p>
   <h3>Curtains colour</h3>

  <p>When it comes to choosing colours for curtains, users can either choose
    either colours that match existing decor and home accessories for harmony,
    or opt for contrasting hues to create a statement.</p>
  <p>Colour also affects transparency. Darker shades are more suitable for
    bedrooms and rooms requiring privacy and less light, for example a dark
    grey curtain or blue curtain would be well suited here. One factor to bear
    in mind is that warm colours can overpower in bright, sunny spaces.</p>
  <p>For homeowners with grey walls, the choice of colour depends on the effect
    desired. Choosing grey curtains will result in an enhanced sense of space.
    Fitting curtains with vibrant colours and patterns will create a striking
    contrast. However, while a bright curtain can make a bold and appealing
    statement piece, be careful not to combine it with other décor items in
    similar shades. For example, if bright blue curtains are desired, pair
    them with smaller blue home accessories in a similar tone, and go for a
    more neutral or toned down colour on the other large elements in the room,
    such as rugs, sofas or walls. URBANARA curtains come in a range of colours,
    such as white, grey, blue, natural, clay, brown and beige, in various tones
    and shades.</p>
   <h3>Style of curtains fixtures</h3>

  <p>Curtains can be fixed in a variety of ways. Increasingly popular are eyelet
    curtains in which metal rings are sewn into the curtain header. Eyelet
    curtains are also called ring top curtains, these are also available with
    ornate designs such as antique silver. Similar are hanging loops made of
    fabric or plastic.</p>
  <p>Other popular options include fabric tunnels. Also known as rod pockets,
    these are reinforced spaces at the top of the curtain into which the rod
    or pole is threaded.</p>
  <p>Other accessories include ties or tiebacks that work to keep curtains
    open. They take the form of cords, sashes, or strips of fabric which can
    also have a nice decorative effect. The types of fixtures offer a more
    modern look, rather than opting for the more traditional eyelet curtains.</p>
   <h2>How to measure curtains</h2>

  <p>Measuring curtains is very straightforward but it's very important to
    do it properly; if the curtains are too short, or appear to be too long,
    it can sit badly with the ambience of the room and take away from the beautiful
    curtain material used. The curtain rod, pole or track should be fitted
    some 15 centimetres above the window recess. Then the next step is to measure
    the width of the window and add on at least another 35 centimetres – you
    can also times the window width by 1.5 depending on how many folds you
    want.</p>
   <h2>Curtains - how far from the floor should they hang?</h2>

  <p>Curtain hanging length depends on preferences, window type, room layout,
    and the presence of items such as radiators or heaters. As a rough rule,
    they should finish around 1.25 centimetres above or 15 centimetres below
    a window sill depending on taste. Long curtains, which tend to be floor
    length, generally end around 1.5 centimetres from the floor, though some
    users prefer the romantic ‘pooling’ look offered byextra-long curtains:
    this is when the curtain panel ‘breaks’ on the floor.</p>
   <h2>Curtains for windows – the benefits</h2>

  <p>Homeowners have many options when it comes to window dressings. So why
    choose curtains?</p>
  <p>One good reason is that curtains are available in a stunning range of
    styles, patterns, colours and materials. This choice allows homeowners
    almost infinite design choices. Long curtains are particularly good at
    emphasising ceiling height in a room; in a building with high ceilings,
    it’s nice to emphasis this feature with a pair of long or floor length
    curtains. However, if looking for drapes for a kitchen or bathroom, shorter
    curtains can be a nicer option as they tend to be less exposed to dirt
    and dust on the floor which is more common in these rooms.</p>
  <p>Other than style choice, homeowners can also choose the ideal curtains
    for their desired privacy, transparency, and heat insulation.</p>
   <h3>Style & interior design</h3>

  <p>With so many styles, textures, patterns and colours available, curtains
    provide users with a rich palette to create their own interior design.
    Subtle grey and blue curtains can blend in for harmony, while more vibrant
    hues can render striking splashes of colour.</p>
   <h3>Curtains for room ambiance</h3>

  <p>Curtains play a key role in establishing the mood and atmosphere of a
    room. Choosing sheer curtains in cotton or linen results in bright and
    airy ambiance in in the daytime. On the other hand, long curtains made
    of heavy fabrics work to create cosy quiet spaces at night especially when
    combined with the artful use of lighting.</p>
  <p>A nice and easy way to create a cohesive look in your home is to pair
    your bedroom or living room curtains with matching cushions. Linen cushions
    are lovely for the bed and sofa in particular. In addition, try matching
    other soft furnishings like blankets and throws with the curtain colour.
    A blue, cream, or grey curtain can easily be paired with a grey alpaca
    blanket, wool blanket, or even a cashmere blanket for something luxurious.</p>
   <h3>Privacy with window curtains</h3>

  <p>Proper window curtains are vital for privacy and their choice depends
    on the use and location of the room and the position of the windows in
    relation to the street outside and neighbouring buildings. One handy option
    is to fit double layer curtains. This comprises of a light fabric next
    to the window pane for daytime use, and a heavier outer one for the evening.
    Layering curtains can also help to adjust the lighting levels in a room.</p>
   <h3>Curtains to assists with temperature control</h3>

  <p>Curtains offer a way to control heat insulation and can be changed as
    required. In hot summers, gauzy fabrics can let in breezes, while in winter
    they can be replaced by thick fabric for warmth.</p>
