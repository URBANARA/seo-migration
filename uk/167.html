  <h2>Wool blankets</h2>
  <h2>Find the perfect wool blanket</h2>
  <p>Wool is a special fibre that possesses a rustic, humble charm. Used for centuries by civilisations around the
      world, it’s been popular for so long thanks to its naturally warming properties and extremely durable
      construction. This, and the fact that wool can be spun and woven to produce a myriad of features, means that
      it’s a brilliant choice for blankets in the home.</p>
  <h2>Advantages of wool blankets</h2>
  <p>Wool is an extremely warm fibre that actively heats in winter, while still allowing air to pass through, so is cool
      in summer. In other words, it’s breathable but cosy, making it ideal for use in the home all year round.
      It’s also hypoallergenic, and bacteria and mite resistant, so great for people with allergies. Unlike
      synthetic fibres, this wonder-fibre tolerates being damp and will dry quickly, so is resistant to mould and
      mildew. A woollen blanket will therefore feel clean and fresh (and odour free) even with heavy handling.</p>
  <p>In addition, wool’s extremely strong. You needn’t worry about over-using your woollen items because
      it’s one of the most durable natural fibres out there. In fact, wool fibres are flexible and hardy enough to
      withstand being bent around 20,000 times. By comparison, synthetically-made rayon can only withstand 75 bends.
      That means that you can wash, bend, throw and completely love your woollen blankets without worrying if
      they’ll pass the test of time. Because of its robustness, wool is resistant to tearing and stretching out of
      shape. This is also thanks to the fact that wool has a slight natural elasticity.</p>
  <p>Their durability makes them easy to care for, too. It can be washed in the washing machine on a wool setting, and
      is crinkle resistant (it never needs to be ironed). Woollen fibres are naturally good at concealing stains and
      dirt (how effective they are obviously depends on the colour you choose) and hold lots of moisture, while still
      staying warm. In need of an impromptu picnic blanket, or a throw for when you’re outside? Just grab one of
      these versatile pieces and you’re ready to go.</p>
  <p>Finally, wool is known to absorb harmful pollutants, to never re-emit them again. This means that using wool in
      your interior decorating can actually help to purify your air for up to 30 years.</p>
  <h2>Affordable wool blankets</h2>
  <p>Despite the material’s amazing properties, woollen blankets are very affordable because the fibre is a
      naturally occurring resource (that is, it’s renewable) and grows back very quickly. It is also sustainable
      and has a low impact on the environment because sheep are not intensively reared, so is easy to produce and
      harvest. Because of this, woollen blankets are affordable and available in abundance. While it’s not a rare
      fibre and does not compete in the softness stakes like cashmere blankets for example, wool is a trusted material
      that offers extremely good value if a good-quality wool is used.</p>
  <p>Of course, the better quality your product is, the better value it will be, because it will last longer if cared
      for correctly. And we absolutely guarantee that all our collections here at URBANARA are the highest quality, and
      are much cheaper than on the high street.</p>
  <h2>When purchasing your woollen blanket online, make sure that…</h2>
  <p>The wool used is of high-quality. Your homewares and accessories will last much longer if they are made of 100%
      pure wool. The best-quality wool products are Woolmark certified, which is an internationally recognised trademark
      and considered the ‘global authority for quality woollen products’. It assesses the quality of wool
      textiles and products only using the most pure, softest, and highest-quality fibres are used. At URBANARA, many of
      our wool blankets are Woolmark certified, so you can be sure that you’re shopping for quality items.
      URBANARA collections that are not Woolmark certified are nonetheless made to an excellent standard, having been
      sourced from wool producers, weavers and mills with generations of weaving experience, and who are considered
      experts in their trade. For this reason, many of URBANARA’s blankets are OEKO-TEX® Standard 100
      certified, which ensures that producers and manufactures adhere to strict environmental and social standards at
      all stages of manufacturing. The result is products of exceptional quality – so when shopping for blankets
      online, this is another great certificate to look for.</p>
  <h2>Pure wool blankets vs. wool blends</h2>
  <p>100% pure wool blankets are great for winter, but blends are wonderful, too. If you opt for a wool blend, ensure
      that the second fibre used is a natural material. This is because, despite this wonder-fibre being so long-lasting
      and easy to care for, synthetic fabrics still snap and stretch out of shape, leaving your blanket it a poor
      condition after a while. Wool can be successfully blended with a number of fibres. Wool-cotton blends are suitable
      for the summertime and in general the warmer months, and can help make the product even more affordable.
      Wool-alpaca blends can lend a little refinement to the finished blanket, making it softer to the touch, and a
      little lighter, too, thanks to the light weight of the alpaca wool. For truly affordable luxury, wool-cashmere
      blankets are delightfully soft, warm and light, easier to care for than pure cashmere, and often less expensive.
      If you’re looking for an affordable treat for yourself, or you want to treat someone special on a budget, a
      wool-cashmere blanket blend is a fantastic option.</p>
  <h2>The different types of woollen blankets</h2>
  <p>Sheep’s wool is generally the one we think of when talking about ‘woollen blankets’, but there
      are actually two other types that also come from sheep (and excluding wool that comes from other animals, like
      alpacas, goats and yaks.</p>
  <p>Indeed, sheep’s wool, depending on what type of sheep it came from and how it is or woven, can have very,
      very different textures and finished. The most common types (apart from standard sheep wool) are lambswool and
      Merino varieties.</p>
  <h2>Lambswool blankets</h2>
  <p>Sometimes referred to as ‘new wool’ or ‘virgin wool’ lambswool is slightly finer than sheep
      wool. It refers to the very first shearing of the animal (usually when it’s around seven months old), making
      it a softer, rarer fabric that requires less processing than other, standard wool.</p>
  <h2>Merino wool blankets</h2>
  <p>Merino wool is another very desirable material for a blanket because it is just as durable and easy to care for as
      standard wool, but has finer fibres that feel softer against the skin. It is not quite as warm as lambswool,
      because it tends to be thinner. Merino wool comes from merino sheep, and there are different grades of this wool,
      too: fine merino wool fibres have a diameter of around 18-20 microns, which is around the same as cashmere! For
      those who suffer from sensitive skin and find wool to be slightly scratchy or irritating against the skin, a
      merino wool blanket (easy to buy online in the UK) is just the thing!</p>
  <h2>Styling woollen blankets</h2>
  <p>Styling woollen blankets – as with all home accessories – depends greatly on the texture and finish.
      Because wool is such a versatile fabric and can look and feel totally different, depending on what type of wool it
      is and how it’s been spun and woven, we wager that no matter what your décor style, palette, or
      penchant, there is bound to be a design that fits your home.</p>
  <p>For a fluffy, ruggedly handsome finish, a twill weave or diamond weave can usually keep a little of the wools
      fluffiness or pile. If you want something smoother, a jacquard weave wool blanket produces a smoother finish with
      less fuzz.</p>
  <p>For a rustic, country-house look, or to add contrast in the form of texture, why not choose a knit? A knitted
      blanket displays a very chunky loop finish that would look superb on a smooth leather sofa, for example.</p>
  <p>Aside from being practical, this simple home living textile is an easy way to update and add a little flair to your
      living room or bedroom. For a pop of colour, choose red, pink, yellow or blue blankets. To help subdue a brightly
      coloured or bold sofa, grey throws work particularly well, or a plaid design in neutral or pared-down shades like
      beige, brown or cream. For a subtle patterned accent, you might also consider a two-toned style, like a
      contrasting herringbone or diamond design finished off with sweet fringing.</p>
  <p>You can often find matching wool blankets and cushions too, which work wonders for creating a stylish and matching
      interior – and extra cosy and warm for the winter months!</p>
  <p>Because wool is such a versatile fabric, it’s great news if you’re searching for a gift, too: beautiful
      wool blankets come in all styles and colours, are universally appealing, and are practical – so make the
      perfect gift for literally everyone. And don’t forget the little ones… which small person
      wouldn’t love kids’ blankets?</p>
