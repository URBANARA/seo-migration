Here at URBANARA, we source all of our products from around the world. One of our favorite countries is Peru, home of the famously soft Alpaca. Our Peru Collection is our selection of our favorite alpaca wool products; blankets, cushions and travel sets all made from beautifully soft Alpaca wool. But it is not the just the wool that comes from Peru; all these products are made in Peru by our trusted and traditional producers out of the famous local alpaca and cashmere. Delivered directly to your door from the Andes Mountains, the URBANARA Peru Collection is the epitome of ethical luxury.
