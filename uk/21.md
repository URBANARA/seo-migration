## Bedspreads & Quilts

**Quilts** have been perennial favourite over many generations. **Quilts** can bring a classic country style to life. Some modern cut quilts will give a bedroom the opposite effect.

Either way, a quilt from URBANARA will be a warm, stylish addition to any bedroom. Match colours and patterns in a quilt with your bedroom colour scheme to create a well-balanced look. Use [bed linen](https://www.urbanara.co.uk/bed-linen) such as [bed sheets](https://www.urbanara.co.uk/bed-sheets) and [blankets](https://www.urbanara.co.uk/blankets-throws) to intensify or highlight the patterns of your quilt.

Use ruffled [cushions](https://www.urbanara.co.uk/cushions) and a matching quilt for comfort and feminising a girl’s room.
