		Bed throws made with love. Direct to you.</h2>
	<h2>
		Why use a bed throw?</h2>
	<p>
		Bright, patterned, warm, inviting: a bed throw is a must-have accessory for any bedroom. Available in a variety of colours and finishes, this unassuming bedding accessory can help to bring a pop of energetic colour to your room, or set a sophisticated accent with luxury fibres and classic designs.</p>
	<p>
		On cooler nights, a bed throw is just the extra bit of warmth you need as the mercury drops, helping you to sleep soundly and comfortably; for the transitional seasons in autumn and spring, it&rsquo;s the perfect go-between cover. But a bed throw is useful during the day, too: lay one over your duvet covers and transform your night bed into a day bed, perfect for reading and relaxing at the weekends.</p>
	<p>
		We introduce new bed throws and blankets each season, so you&rsquo;re bound to find a new piece you love if you&rsquo;re changing the d&eacute;cor of your bedroom&hellip; Stylish, warm and versatile, a bedspread is a bound to be a piece you&rsquo;ll love yourself for having invested in.</p>
	<h2>
		Bed throws made of natural fibres</h2>
	<p>
		No matter what style or colour you opt for, investing in a design that is made from 100% natural materials, like pure wool or cotton, makes a world of difference.</p>
	<p>
		Synthetic fibres like faux fur don&rsquo;t breathe, and cause you to sweat during the night, or when you&rsquo;re lying on it with bare skin as a day bed. In addition, unnatural fibres attract dust and are allergenic, trapping mites and bacteria that can irritate those who suffer from allergies.</p>
	<p>
		Natural fibres, on the other hand, are breathable, so help your bed feel fresh and clean, keeping you warm in winter and cool in summer.</p>
	<p>
		What&rsquo;s more, you needn&rsquo;t spend the earth to find a high-quality, long-lasting piece: URBANARA goes direct to the producers to source and develop its collections.

	<h2>
		Quilted bed throws, cotton bed throws or woollen bed throws: which is right for you?</h2>
	<h3>
		Quilted bed throws</h3>
	<p>
		Quilted bed throws or bedspreads are typically filled with a wadding, meaning they&rsquo;re heavier than single-layer throws, and so better suited for wintertime. A quilted bedspread usually has a cotton shell and is filled with a wool or a polyester filling. Because of the seams that run through the bedspread to hold the filling in place, a quilted blanket will not drape as well as a cotton or wool design, so is better suited for the bed, rather than a sofa or armchair.</p>
	<h3>
		Cotton bed throws</h3>
	<p>
		Cotton blankets and throws are not as warm as a quilted one, but it is more versatile, because you&rsquo;ll be able to use it in other rooms in your home, like the living room on the sofa or in the guest room to place on a day bed. Cotton designs often display intricate woven detailing and interesting textures, too: when constructed with a jacquard weave, a cotton fabric can be woven into soft and voluminous waffle designs, chequered patterns, herringbone styles, and even with eyelet reliefs.</p>
	<h3>
		Woollen bed throws</h3>
	<p>
		If you&rsquo;re looking for something in between a warm, quilted bedspread and an oversized cotton throw, you&rsquo;ll probably find that a wool blanket fits the bill perfectly. Thick wool bed throws are plush and cosy, drape beautifully, are available in a range of colours and styles, and can be used in all rooms of the home &ndash; and even double as a coat blanket on cold days! Wool can be woven into myriad finishes, and URBANARA&rsquo;s collection ranges from cable-knit designs and blankets with fringing and tasselled edges &ndash; so there&rsquo;s bound to be a high-quality woollen blanket for you.</p>
	<h2>
		Which size bed throws for which bed?</h2>
	<p>
		The majority of our bed throws come in several sizes and are suitable for single, double and queen-size beds. In addition, a selection of the URBANARA bestsellers is also available in a king size, leaving enough room to hang over the sides and to cover your bedding. If you&rsquo;re looking to use your throw as a bedspread, you should select a style that leaves ample room at the sides and end of the bed. When shopping for a single, aim for at minimum size of 180 x 230 cm, for a double, 240 x 265 cm, and for a king size, 275 x 265 cm. This will ensure you have enough overhang on all sides, so it looks fantastic by day and is comfortable to use as night time.</p>
	<h2>
		Styling your bed throws</h2>
	<p>
		A statement blanket will make your bed a feature of the room, so be sure to select a style you absolutely love! (When you shop with us, feel confident knowing that if your home wares aren&rsquo;t exactly how you imagined them, you can send them back free of charge with 100 days &ndash; it&rsquo;s our Love at First Touch Guarantee.</p>
	<p>
		Choose bold statement colours such as mustard yellow or rust orange to instantly inject a burst of colour into any room. Pair a bright complementary colour with the cushions or pillows to up the impact.</p>
	<p>
		For an elegant, classic look, choose a grey bedspread. Grey works well in all seasons and is calming and soothing, promoting rest and relaxation. A grey bed throw works wonders with warm-coloured <a href="/bed-linen">bed linen</a>, for example red, orange, pink, or bordeaux. It also compliments monochromatic rooms, and can inject interest into black and white interiors.</p>
	<p>
		For a unified and polished look, try to match your bedding layers with the rest of the d&eacute;cor in your room, like <a href="/rugs">rugs</a>, <a href="/curtains">curtains</a>, and cushions. Green and blue are classic colour schemes for bedrooms, and a single blanket draped over the bed helps to tie the whole palette together.</p>
	<p>
		For a touch of luxury, browse bed throws that are made with a wool blend: silk, alpaca or cashmere are sumptuously soft and hard-wearing fibres that will bring a touch of refinement to your home.</p>
	<p>
		As well as making fantastic bedroom accessories, they can also be draped over other furniture, including sofas, armchairs or generally anything that needs a burst of colour or warming extra layer.</p>
	<h2>
		Bed throws as gifts</h2>
	<p>
		The gender-neutral design of our bed throws means they make excellent gifts. For something particularly special, like for an anniversary or wedding gift, consider buying one that&rsquo;s made from a luxury fabric, like a large cashmere blanket or a wool-silk blend.
