  <h2>Bedside Lamps</h2>
  <h2>How strong should my bedside lamps be?</h2>
  <p>Like a standard table lamp, a bedside lamp should be between 40 and 60 watts. Position it right next to your bed,
      with the shade around forty centimetres higher than the top of your matress, if you prefer reading sitting up. If
      you read while lying down, it is best if the bulb sits slightly lower. If you like to mix it up (read sitting up
      after a long weekend sleep-in, and lying down before bed during the week), opt for a design that’s somewhere
      between 20 and 40 centimetres, which is the perfect strength for reading.</p>
  <p>If you appreciate the modern and post-industrial aesthetic of bare bulbs, you can use them for bedside lamps, but
      it’s important to only use a filament lightbulb. These bulbs are designed to cast a soft light with minimal
      glare, which you can look at directly without squinting. For filament bulbs in shade-less bedside lamps, best
      stick to a lower strength, 30 – 40 watts is ideal.</p>
  <p>Because bedside lamps often double as reading lamps, they should cast a light that is easy to read and concentrate
      by. A natural-coloured light is therefore advised. When choosing a design with a lampshade, then, ensure that
      it’s a natural, neutral colour: white, cream and light grey are perfect. Light blue, green and black are
      also possible, because the light they cast is cool. A red or orange shade, on the other hand, will give you a
      lightly tinged illumination which can strain the eyes if used for too long.</p>
  <h2>Styling a bedside lamp: symmetry is key</h2>
  <p>Symmetry in interior decorating is a cornerstone of good design, and with two matching bedside lamps, it’s
      easy to achieve in the bedroom. Symmetry creates a visual calm – a desirable effect in the room where you go
      to rest. It is also a particularly useful tool if you’re aiming to make a big lighting statement! An
      oversized or statement lamp can be a sensational design feature in the bedroom, but can look off or unbalanced if
      it’s only on one side of the bed. To balance the look, make sure that you use one on each side of the bed,
      placed on a small, pared-back bedside table, so that it doesn’t detract from the style of the
      accessory.</p>
  <h2>Matching a bedside lamp with other elements in your décor</h2>
  <p>When you’re making a statement, it’s often the case that you fall in love with a particular lighting
      collection, before having chosen other elements of your décor. But it can actually be easy and affordable
      to restyle the other accessories in your room… so once you’ve placed a bedside lamp on either side of
      your bed, it’s time to make the rest of your room look the part.</p>
  <p>If you have fallen in love with a style with a coloured textile lampshade, try to find bed linen that matches
      – or complements! – the colour. Grey throws look gorgeous alongside burgundy red lamps, for example.
      For metallic designs, pair with cushions in similar hues.</p>
  <p>If you prefer an angular, sculptural base, consider replicating the shape in the form of geometric rug or a
      bedspread. A traditional style lamp can be tied in with a classic-looking wool blanket, too. Remember to check
      whether the design you’ve chosen is available in a matching set: many of URBANARA’s bedside and table
      lamp collections, for example, are available as floor lamps or pendant lamps, too.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <h2>What style lamp should I choose?</h2>
  <p>Bedside lamps can come in all shapes and sizes, so the first thing to consider when buying one is how it will fit
      with the rest of your room. While different styles will complement different décors, there are a few tricks
      to help you get the right look.</p>
  <p>Collections made from natural wood will ‘warm up’ a room, even when they’re switched off, thanks
      to the natural warming properties of the material. Wooden lamps bode well in Scandinavian style bedrooms, but also
      those with rustic and traditional interiors; the shape of the frame will make all the difference.</p>
  <p>A metallic design in chrome, brushed steel or matt black or grey will have maximum impact in a contemporary
      interior, while one in brass, gold or copper will bring a touch of glamour to the room. A desk style lamp can also
      work well in a sleek, modern space.</p>
  <p>For period and eclectic interiors, why not opt for something in a natural stone, like marble? Elegant and timeless,
      a natural marble finish will make a tasteful statement – and there are dozens of table lamps that work
      beautifully next to the bed.</p>
  <p>For something a little more contemporary, a bare bulb pendant is just the thing – but again, remember to
      choose a dim filament bulb.</p>
