<div>Our mattress protectors generally come in single, double, king-size, super-king and emperor sizes, and range from 4
    millimetres thick to 10 centimetres thick.  All are made with breathable material which ensures the cold is
    kept out in winter months whilst still making sure air is circulated during the hotter summer months. Match your
    mattress protector with our various ranges of bed linen to complete your bedding collection. As some of our mattress
    protectors are made in faraway parts of the world, this may result in a longer delivery time. All of our mattress
    protectors are easy to wash - we recommend washing them at 40°C with similar colours. Please do not bleach
    tumble dry or iron. All of our mattress protectors are of real high-quality - to find out more about the factors we
    take into consideration when determining quality, please see our quality charter.</div>
