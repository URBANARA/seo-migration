  <h1>Kids&#39; blankets</h1>
  <h2>Give your little one a kids&rsquo; blanket they&rsquo;ll love forever</h2>
  <p>Blankets are a special thing for kids. The blanket is the symbol of security, providing warmth and comfort
      throughout the day and night. It&rsquo;s supposed to be cosy and comfortable, encouraging sweet dreams at night,
      and security during the day&hellip; So when you&rsquo;re choosing a blanket for your children, it&rsquo;s
      important that it&rsquo;s soft, warm, cuddly and will last a long time so it can be loved for years.</p>
  <h2>Kids blankets that are made from natural materials</h2>
  <p>When choosing a blanket for your child, it&rsquo;s really important to make sure it&rsquo;s made from 100% natural
      fibres which promote healthy living and are gentle against sensitive skin.</p>
  <p>Especially in the bedroom, a blanket made from 100% pure wool or cotton will promote deep and healthy sleep for
      child because they&rsquo;re breathable and allow natural heat-regulation. If your child comes home with a cold or
      the &lsquo;flu, natural materials will help their bodies self-regulate, ensuring they don&rsquo;t overheat.
      Plastic materials like polyester or even fleece blankets don&rsquo;t breathe, so your child is more likely to
      sweat and overheat.</p>
  <p>Moreover, because they are breathable, natural fibres are naturally anti-allergenic, and unlike synthetic fibres,
      don&rsquo;t attract dust. The structure of polyester and synthetic fleece blankets makes them a breeding ground
      for mites and other bedbugs, which can cause skin and breathing irritations. Kids who suffer from allergies in
      particular will benefit from nap and bed blankets made from pure, natural fibres.</p>
  <p>Whether napping with their sofa throw or they&rsquo;re turning in for the night, the best children&rsquo;s blankets
      are made from high-quality natural materials&hellip; helping them to get deep and regular sleep.</p>
  <h2>Why invest in babies&rsquo; &amp; kids&rsquo; blankets?</h2>
  <p>A soft, warm blanket will follow your child everywhere, from when they are small babies to when they&rsquo;re
      toddlers, and right up to when they&rsquo;re young children.</p>
  <p>From the very first months, a beautiful kids&rsquo; blanket will serve your perfectly as a swaddling blanket in the
      cot, keeping your babies&rsquo; arms tucked up tightly, making sure they stay warm and secure.</p>
  <p>When going for walks on chilly days, a blanket will keep your child snug as a bug in a rug in the pram or the
      buggy. Cocoon them in their throw, fasten them in the chair, and you&rsquo;re ready for the outing: come what
      may.</p>
  <p>When it comes to naptime, a familiar, well-loved blanket can help your little one feel safe, secure, and calm,
      promoting sound and restful sleep. When he or she is awake, a good quality blanket will provide insulation for
      little people&rsquo;s behinds are they&rsquo;re playing on cold or hard floors&hellip; or a little extra padding
      when on a play mat.</p>
  <h2>What material should I buy?</h2>
  <p>Whatever you (or your child) uses their blanket or throw for, there are lots of great natural fibres to choose
      from. In the summertime, or for a light layer, a cotton design is ideal because it&rsquo;s light, breathable and
      easy to clean.</p>
  <p>If you&rsquo;re going to use it often in the pram or buggy, wool blankets are a fantastic because it saps moisture
      from the body, keeping your child warm, even if it&rsquo;s a bit damp.</p>
  <p>For something soft and warm, an alpaca blanket is great because of its insulating properties, and it doesn&rsquo;t
      have the prickling effect that sheep&rsquo;s wool has.</p>
  <p>In fact, most natural materials make suitable kids&rsquo; blankets! The only thing to remember is to choose a plain
      weave or tightly woven design, to avoid little fingers getting between the knits and pulling at them.</p>
  <p>The one fabric this isn&rsquo;t suitable for children are mohair blankets, because of its extremely fluffy pile.
      This fluff might find its way into your child&rsquo;s mouth, and while it&rsquo;s a durable fibre, you want to
      avoid small strands of the hair becoming loose.</p>
  <h2>For long-lasting kids&rsquo; blankets, choose natural fibres</h2>
  <p>Kids can give homewares a good run for their money, so at URBANARA, we make sure that all our kids&rsquo;
      collections are made according to the highest standards and are totally kid-proof. For us, this means ensuring
      that all our kids&rsquo; blankets have been made according to strict quality standards, and so natural materials
      is a must.</p>
  <p>Why? An additional advantage of selecting natural materials is their durability compared with synthetic
      alternatives: with proper care, a wool, cotton or alpaca blanket will last many, many years &ndash; even after
      they&rsquo;re put through intense periods of love by your little ones! For example, wool fibres can withstand
      being bent up to 20,000 times. Cotton is less, at 3,000 &ndash; but it&rsquo;s still much, much more durable than
      rayon, which can only withstand being bent around 75 times! What this translates to is a blanket that is much more
      resistant to tearing, stretching out of shape, and pilling, even after many washes&hellip; and one that you
      won&rsquo;t feel bad about leaving lying around the living room when friends visit.</p>
  <h2>The best blankets for kids</h2>
  <p>The best blankets for kids are ones that are healthy, long lasting, and something they won&rsquo;t grow out of. We
      needn&rsquo;t tell parents twice that kids out-grow their belongings quickly, whether it&rsquo;s because they no
      longer fit into it, or because their tastes have changed. Blankets, as most parents will quickly work out, are
      important comforters for kids, so they&rsquo;ll want to keep them around for a while.</p>
  <p>So when you&rsquo;re shopping for kids&rsquo; blankets, buying something that lasts &ndash; not just in terms of
      durability &ndash; but also in terms of something they won&rsquo;t get bored of is doubly important. While kids
      might like the sound of characters on their blankets and bed linen, they won&rsquo;t want to keep it for long.
      Instead, invest in timeless designs that they won&rsquo;t simply get bored of in a few months. This doesn&rsquo;t
      mean that kids&rsquo; blankets can&rsquo;t be colourful, though! Pick pretty patterns like polka-dots, stripes, or
      animal motifs that are still playful, but tasteful, too.</p>
  <p>It&rsquo;s also comforting to know that your kids&rsquo; blanket won&rsquo;t simply be thrown in the rubbish when
      you little one&rsquo;s grown up. High-quality blankets can be handed down to other children or passed on to others
      in need. This makes them infinitely better for the environment so you&rsquo;ll contributing to a better world for
      their future.</p>
  <h2>Girls&rsquo; Blankets</h2>
  <p>For girls&rsquo; blankets, there&rsquo;s a lot more than pink: green, pale blue, pastels, and yellows are all
      pretty and quaint. Spotted designs are fun, while a muted colourful geometric pattern gives their room vibrancy
      and energy.</p>
  <h2>Boys&rsquo; blankets</h2>
  <p>There&rsquo;s more than just blue for little boys&rsquo; blankets&rsquo;, too! A nautical theme of blue, red and
      white is perfect for aspiring pirates, while an African animal theme is excellent for budding explorers. Spots and
      stripes in yellow, green, blue and grey are all fun and energetic, too.</p>
  <p>Whatever design you choose, think about pairing it with a fun coloured rug for softness and comfort underfoot
      &ndash; or pick a blanket that matches the other pieces for a room that that will have them aching to show off to
      their friends. With a range of cosy blankets and throws, you&rsquo;ll be able to swathe their bed or playroom with
      gorgeous fibres in beautiful colours that create a delightful and healthy area for play and sleep.</p>
  <h2>Blankets for kids with sensitive skin and allergies</h2>
  <p>As we mentioned, choosing pieces made from natural fibres can help kids who suffer from allergies, but some fibres
      are better than others for kids who are prone to skin or repertory allergies.</p>
  <p>For children with sensitive skin, steer clear of sheep&rsquo;s wool, which can be irritating and scratchy for young
      sensitive skin. Instead, opt for alpaca, cashmere or merino wool &ndash; which is almost as soft as cashmere.</p>
  <p>For kids with allergies, alpaca is a great option because it is warmer than sheep&rsquo;s wool, not prickly, and
      because it contains no lanolin, is hypoallergenic. The same applies for cashmere wool, too.</p>
  <h2>Baby&rsquo;s blankets</h2>
  <p>Babies&rsquo; skin is very delicate and fragile, so it&rsquo;s important to choose a fibre that is soft, silky and
      warm. Rather than sheep&rsquo;s wool, which young children can complain of being prickly, it is best to choose a
      softer, finer fibre. Of all textiles and fabrics, cashmere and alpaca are hands down the softest and gentlest,
      perfect for young skin.</p>
  <h2>Kids&rsquo; personalised blankets</h2>
  <p>If you&rsquo;re looking for a special comforter for a child, look no further than a beautiful, high-quality blanket
      that has been personalised as a part of your gift.</p>
  <h3>Monogrammed kids&rsquo; blankets</h3>
  <p>For a milestone occasion like finishing kindergarten and starting school, or a special event like welcoming a new
      brother or sister into the home, a monogrammed blanket is a beautiful and personal gift that every child is sure
      to love. Their own personal comforter with their name or initials on it is sure to be a gift that will be truly
      special to them in their own way.</p>
  <h3>Embroidered kids&rsquo; blankets</h3>
  <p>If you want to make a special occasion in another way, consider embroidering a coat of arms, a logo or simple
      picture, or a message on the blanket that means something to your child. Whether you&rsquo;re wishing them a happy
      birthday or sending love, a personal embroidered blanket makes a thoughtful gift.</p>
  <h2>Kids&rsquo; blanket sizes</h2>
  <p>Kids&rsquo; blankets come in many sizes, and standard blanket sizes can also be suitable if you&rsquo;re using them
      exclusively in the buggy or as a winter layer. If you&rsquo;re looking for a christening or swaddling blanket,
      then go for something a little smaller; around 70 x 95 cm is ideal. For the cot, pram, or buggy, choose something
      a bit larger so you can wrap your little one up from head to toe. For this, around 130 x 170 cm is perfect. This
      size works as an extra layer on the bed, too, but if you&rsquo;re looking for a kids&rsquo; bedspread, a standard
      single size is the best bet (180 x 230 cm). For kids&rsquo; bedding, a standard cot size is 100 x 135 cm, while a
      standard kid&rsquo;s single is 135 x 200 cm.</p>
