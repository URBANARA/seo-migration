<h1>Brass wall lights | Spherical pendant lamps</h1>
<h2>Brass & copper wall lamps</h2>
<p>Wall lights with metallic finishes are an excellent way to add flair and atmosphere to your home. Whether you have a
    neutral, colourful or monotone colour scheme, a hint of copper or brass will elevate your décor and inject a
    touch of richness to your space. It also means that brass and copper wall lights will always suit your interior, so
    as long as you choose a timeless design, you won’t have to replace them if you redecorate. For this reason,
    opt for clean, simple lighting that borrows from classic designs. Spherical wall lamps (and pendant lamps, too) are
    ideal: reminiscent of the 1920s and 1960s, you can be sure that a ball-shaped light fixture will never go out of
    style. If you’re looking to create an inviting atmosphere in your home, look no further than metallic wall
    lamps to create ambient light. By selecting a versatile magnetic design that allows you to detach the lamp from the
    base, a customised lighting solution can be achieved no matter what the occasion.</p>
<h2>Ball wall lights and spherical pendant lamps</h2>
<p><pr>Ball and spherical lighting are timeless designs that truly compliment all interiors. Often borrowing from the
    interior trends of the mid-twentieth century, ball wall lamps are sleek and smooth, and depending on whether you
    select a glass pendant or a metallic one, are appropriate for use in all areas of your home. Copper ball pendant
    lamps are reminiscent of 1920s bistros, as well as elegant cinema foyers of the same era. Hung in a line of two or
    three, brass or copper pendant lights look the part over dining tables and in the living room. Transparent glass
    pendant lamps cast a wider, more diffused light, and so are more suitable for the bathroom and bedroom; though they
    can also be used to light living and kitchen areas. Whatever design you choose, spherical lighting and brass and
    copper wall lamps are an incredibly easy way to add a touch of timeless glamour to your home, and they don’t
    need to be switched on to shine.</pr></p>
