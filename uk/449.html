<h1>Cushion covers</h1>
<h2>The endless possibilities with cushion covers</h2>
<p>Cushion covers come in all shapes, sizes, materials, colours, textures and with different embellishments: indeed,
    there are few homewares that are as versatile as this humble homeware accessory! Thanks to this, Not only practical
    (for those night spent curled up on the sofa, or the days you spend leisurely reading in bed), cushion covers have
    the power to completely transform a room. With a little thought and creativity, a few cushion covers will turn your
    sofa into a statement, your bed into the spotlight of the room, and your floor into the place where you actually
    want to sit&hellip; But before you buy yours, here&rsquo;s a quick materials and styling guide to help you pick the
    perfect ones for your home.</p>
<h2>Cotton Cushion Covers</h2>
<p><pr>The advantage of cotton cushion covers is that they&rsquo;re suitable for use all year round. While wool covers
    can feel a little warm in the summertime, cotton designs are comfortable to lean against or lie on when it&rsquo;s
    hot, but also offer comfort when it&rsquo;s cold &ndash; whether they add warmth or not. Cotton can also be woven
    into a smooth, flat fabric too, making it ideal for printing patterns and designs. With screen printing, for
    example, there is no limit to the designs possible: fine, geometric print cushion covers, floral patterns, tribal
    prints, or bright, metallic detailing can all be applied. Depending on the weave, cotton cushion covers can also
    have patterns and designs woven into them. A jacquard weave in particular can create herringbone or textured
    finishes, which provide a more subtle look than rotary or screen printed designs. Keep in mind that as cotton
    created relatively fine threads, a heavily textured collection (that is, one that has the pattern woven into the
    design) will be a little stiffer and heavier than normal, since it requires more fabric to create the effect. This
    of course also means that it will be very durable.</pr></p>
<h2>Ikat cushion covers</h2>
<p>Are an extremely popular interior styling choice because they are each unique and add a special statement to an
    interior. The patterns typically seen in traditional ikat cushions are created by dying the threads before they are
    woven. This technique, which is practiced in several cultures around the world including regional peoples in Japan,
    Malaysia, Indonesia and ancient Persia, creates a design that looks slightly &lsquo;imperfect&rsquo;, since the
    colours appear to bleed into one another subtly for soft, blurred edges. Ikat cushion are usually bright and
    colourful &ndash; by definition they need at least two colours in them &ndash; and they will more often than not be
    contrasting hues, rather than several hues of the same colour. This weaving technique requires a vast amount of
    skill and precision, since all threads need to be dyed evenly in order to produce a uniform design. In the home,
    Ikat cushions are a beautiful decorating accessory because each one is unique and make for a small yet impactful
    accent: a few handmade cushion covers will completely transform a tired sofa or bedroom!</p>
<h2>Linen cushion covers</h2>
<p><pr>Linen is an excellent fibre to use around the home: it&rsquo;s antistatic, so won&rsquo;t attract dust,
    hypoallergenic, so is great for allergy sufferers, is extremely durable, becoming softer with each wash, and is
    absurdly easy to care for &ndash; simply pop it in the washing machine. Linen scatter cushions and other home
    accessories are particularly suitable for warmer months because the fibre is breathable, absorbent and
    heat-regulating, feeling very cool against the skin. Linen has a lovely earthy texture though, so when paired with
    cushion covers made of wool or cashmere, for example, provide wonderful textural diversity; consider pairing
    cushions made from different materials for a visually (and tactilely!) appealing room.</pr></p>
<h2>Wool and alpaca cushion covers</h2>
<p><pr>It&rsquo;s not the first fabric that comes to mind for a cushion cover, but wool and alpaca made stunning cushion
    covers that really up your winter d&eacute;cor! Warm, soft, and 100% natural fibre, Urbanara&rsquo;s wool cushion
    covers are extremely high-quality and will add an instant element of warm, inviting texture to your home. Wool can
    be woven into fine, smooth materials using a plain or jacquard weave In addition, because wool fibres are thicker
    than cotton or linen fibres, woven patterns using two or more different coloured threads are more common in woollen
    collections: a classic herringbone or chevron pattern is can easily be achieved with a jacquard wool weave, and look
    simply stunning on the sofa next to a throw or blanket. Wool cushion covers can also be woven using a thick, chunky
    weave for a really textured, tactile finish. Although a large, chunky knit cushion cover might seem more of a winter
    accent, don&rsquo;t dismiss them in your summer and spring living and bedroom: in cool, pastel shades, a chunky
    weave often displays a casual look that fits perfectly with lazy, hot days.</pr></p>
<h2>Mohair cushion covers</h2>
<p>Fuzzy, lustrous, and incredibly warm, a mohair cushion cover will make your sofa or bed winter-proof. Mohair takes
    very well to dye, too, so mohair accents are often available in bright, complementary colours: perfect for cushion
    covers and small decorative pieces. Because they are such a statement, matching mohair cushions and blankets are a
    fab choice for living room styling &ndash; even in different hues, their texture makes it clear that they go
    together, so you can be playful with your palette and give your space a happy pop of colour.</p>
<h2>Cashmere cushion covers</h2>
<p><pr>If you want to inject a bit of everyday luxury into your room but don&rsquo;t want to go as far as a velvet sofa,
    cashmere accessories are the perfect way to do it. Sumptuously soft and silky, cashmere fibres are woven from
    cashmere goats, which are native to Mongolia, and which are adapted to bitter cold winters. Cushion covers made from
    this downy, velvety fibre will be the ones that you reach for time and time again thanks to the comfort and warmth
    that only cashmere can provide. For affordable everyday luxury, cashmere cushion covers really are the way to
    go.</pr></p>
<h2>Embroidered covers</h2>
<p><pr>Embroidery is not as prevalent as it once was, but it&rsquo;s perfect for creating a feminine, delicate look. If
    there is anywhere to introduce this style into the home, cushions are a great place to start. Embroidery is often
    very intricate and detailed, so consider designs that use the same colour stitching as the base fabric for a more
    subtle look.</pr></p>
<h2>Styling with scatter cushions</h2>
<p><pr>Scatter cushions work both in the living room and the bedroom and are a seriously affordable update that really
    packs a style punch. If your home is looking a little tired or you&rsquo;re getting a little bored of your colour
    scheme, swap over a few of your scatter cushion covers and give your room a new lease on life. If you&rsquo;re
    starting at the beginning, there are a few rules of thumb to follow, or tips that will help you decide which styles
    you should choose. First, it&rsquo;s good to remember that square cushion covers are incredibly easy to style:
    whether you&rsquo;re choosing the same sizes or a combination of small and large ones, layer or pile cushions on a
    bed in any way you choose for a feature in your room. The only thing to remember is, unless you&rsquo;re using plain
    cushion covers, you should aim for a balance of patterns and hues, and try to achieve a sense of symmetry: three red
    cushion covers followed by three cream or grey cushion covers isn&rsquo;t restful on the eye &ndash; mix them up and
    alternate the colours instead. If you&rsquo;re looking to experiment a little with the d&eacute;cor in your home,
    this humble accessory can help you get a feel for the pallets and patters you really love, before committing to
    larger pieces (like blankets, <u>bedspreads</u>, <u>curtains</u> or rugs). For example, a simple cushion cover in a
    geometric print is an excellent candidate for pattern blocking: pair geometric, woven or tribal designs on the sofa
    for a serious interior statement. Mix complementary colours for an eye-catching arrangement, and play with sizes
    too: cushion covers are available in many sizes, most commonly in 40 x 40 cm, 45 x 45 cm, or 50 x 50 cm. Rectangular
    ones are popular as well: a 40 x 60 cm cushion cover will pair really well with a square one around the same size.
    When buying several at once, think about how size and colour will work together. Perhaps buy plain square covers and
    use the rectangular ones are bold pattern accents? The possibilities and endless, and the beauty of these
    accessories is that they can literally look different in every room, depending on how they are styled, how many
    there are, and which other patterns they&rsquo;re married with.</pr></p>

    your d&eacute;cor versatile, investing in cushion covers is a wonderfully affordable solution. By buying several
    covers in different patterns and colours, you can replace and mix and match the styles as you please. In summertime,
    for example, you can bring out the striped cushion covers (stripes are quintessentially summery!) and use cooler,
    fresher or fruitier palettes. In wintertime and when the weather gets a little cooler, pull out the woollen,
    knitted, and warm-coloured covers for an instant cold-weather update! Before replacing one cover with another,
    consider giving your cushion insert a little love and having them dry cleaned to keep them fresh and free from
    mites. Wash your covers too before storing them: this will keep them in top condition and ready to use when
    you&rsquo;re ready to swap back. Even though they are small living room accents, good-quality cushion covers will
    really make your home look and feel expensive &ndash; and you won&rsquo;t have to be scared of actually using and
    enjoying them. While they are versatile and not as big a d&eacute;cor commitment than say, a sofa &ndash; it pays to
    invest in cushion covers that will still look beautiful after heavy use, so you won&rsquo;t have to replace them
    each season (which is the case with many models that are mass produced and made from synthetic materials). All
    Urbanara&rsquo;s cushion covers are made using only the finest natural materials and produced by the best makers we
    could find. Because of this, and despite the wear and love that cushion covers sustain on a daily basis, all our
    collections are made to last, and will look as gorgeous as the day you bought them&hellip; even after many seasons.
    Urbanara&rsquo;s cushion covers are always finished with high-quality buttons or a zipper, too, so you can remove
    the insert, allowing them to be cleaned on a regular basis. Just remember that different fibres have different care
    requirements, so be sure to check the washing guide before you pop it in the washing machine; and remember to remove
    the cushion insert before any cleaning takes place, too!</pr></p>
