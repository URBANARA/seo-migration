<div>The fitting of our lamps depends on the material but make sure the mounting
  surface and fastening elements are capable of bearing the weight of the
  lamp. Always use screws and plugs that are specially suited to the lamp’s
  material. Many of our lamps come with a manual to help you install it. </div>
