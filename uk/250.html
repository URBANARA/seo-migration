		Storage</h2>
	<p>
		These lovely storage solutions from URBANARA can transform a cluttered home into a neat and orderly &ndash; and stylish &ndash; sanctuary.</p>
	<p>
		Clutter is the bane of modern life as books, toys, clothes, laundry, and countless other items not currently needed take up valuable space, especially in bedrooms, living rooms and bathrooms. Luckily, help is at hand in the form of the fine storage solutions which you can shop online for at URBANARA.</p>
	<p>
		Our line of practical baskets, boxes and trunks come in a myriad of styles ranging from minimalist Scandinavian to tropical Javanese. Lovingly hand-woven from materials such as rattan, seagrass and bamboo, our baskets will make short work of any storage problems while adding a charming natural touch to any room.</p>
	<h2>
		What to use storage baskets for ?</h2>
	<p>
		Storage baskets can be used throughout the house to maintain order by stashing away everything from laundry to books. They&rsquo;re the heavy lifters of the storage world but that doesn&rsquo;t mean they need to be dull. Quite the reverse. URBANARA&rsquo;s collection features a lovely range of hand-woven storage baskets that radiate a beguiling sense of style while keeping everything safe, clean and in its proper place.</p>
	<h2>
		Storage baskets &ndash; great for the laundry and much more</h2>
	<p>
		One major storage task is keeping dirty clothes, <a href="http://www.urbanara.co.uk/towels">towels</a> and <a href="http://www.urbanara.co.uk/bed-linen">bed linen</a> safely out of the way between washing days. URBANARA&rsquo;s range of storage and laundry baskets are the perfect storage solution. Great looking in any setting, they feature handy touches such as removable cotton linings, firm-fitting lids and stable handles. Lined laundry baskets are especially important because it prevents linens and clothes from snagging, and in fact, our baskets function as handy portable linen closets &ndash; completely lined and breathable &ndash; to keep laundry out of sight until wash day. The removable lining allow the inner fabric to be washed as and when you want, keeping your home just that bit more fresh and tidy.</p>
	<p>
		Several of URBANARA&rsquo;s extra large laundry baskets also have separate compartments to make separating colours from blacks and whites easy.</p>
	<p>
		While perfect for housing dirty laundry, they are also ideal for use as linen trunks in the <a href="http://www.urbanara.co.uk/bedroom">bedroom</a> or an airing cupboard. They allow the air to circulate and, especially with a natural lavender sachet or similar, will keep your linens smelling fresh.</p>
	<p>
		Our lovely rattan baskets also serve perfectly as general storage for a wide range of items, too: from shoes, books and magazines to <a href="http://www.urbanara.co.uk/pillows">pillows</a>, <a href="http://www.urbanara.co.uk/bedspreads-quilts">bedspreads</a>, <a href="http://www.urbanara.co.uk/blankets-throws">throws and blankets</a>, if it needs storing, our storage boxes are suitable.</p>
	<h2>
		What are storage trunks, baskets and boxes made from</h2>
	<p>
		In line with our eco-friendly worldview, our storage baskets and boxes are mostly made from natural materials. Along with bamboo, rattan, seagrass, linen and cotton, we also value the qualities of more exotic fibres such as pandan and banana leaves, water hyacinth, and straw. Each design has been handmade by expert craftsmen and women who have been fairly compensated for their work, and whose crafting skills were passed down by generations; so you know each basket will stand the test of time.</p>
	<h3>
		Other materials for woven storage boxes and containers</h3>
	<p>
		While favouring the organic, we do use synthetics when warranted. One example is our <a href="http://www.urbanara.co.uk/6286/black-white-brown-champa-storage-box.htm">CHAMPA</a> range of laundry and general storage baskets, boxes and racks. These include items fashioned from a cotton blend fabric to ensure a desirable resistance to mould and moisture.</p>
	<h3>
		Woven rattan storage baskets</h3>
	<p>
		Rattan is the dream material for storage baskets owing to its durability and timeless wicker weave style. Strong enough for any job and refreshingly lightweight, wicker storage baskets also add an appealing texture to any space. In particular, white storage baskets made from rattan bring a lovely sense of relaxation to bedrooms and <a href="http://www.urbanara.co.uk/living">living</a> rooms.</p>
