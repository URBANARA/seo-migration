  <h2>Mohair blankets</h2>
  <h2>Where do mohair blankets come from?</h2>
  <p>Mohair wool comes from the Angora goat, which was native to the mountains of Tibet where the high altitudes make
      the winters bitter cold and very windy. Angora goats' coats therefore needed to protect them from minus
      temperatures – their fur, then, has natural warming properties while remaining very light-weight. These
      qualities make them perfect for winter accessories like hats, scarves and gloves... and a naturally excellent
      choice for blankets and throws.</p>
  <p>When buying mohair blankets online from URBANARA, know that your blanket has been made with extra care in Spain by
      a small, expert weaving mill that has been running for generations.</p>
  <h2>What's so special about mohair blankets?</h2>
  <p>Mohair blankets are characterised by a fluffy, cosy pile and a magnificent natural sheen. Often, mohair blankets
      display strong, bright colours (thanks to the fact that the fibres take do dye extremely well), and are big and
      perfect to cuddle up under, but still very comfortable and light-weight. Mohair feels smooth, soft and silky. It
      is most commonly blended with another fibre like wool: this allows the mohair pile to be woven onto a durable
      base, making the throw resilient and extra durable.</p>
  <p>Unlike wool blankets however, mohair blankets won't scratch, so it's a good option for people with very
      sensitive skin.</p>
  <h3>A mohair blend blanket is very durable</h3>
  <p>This special fibre is resilient and durable. It has a slight elasticity, which makes textiles make of the material
      naturally tear and stretch resistant. Mohair is strong, too, so it won't break like synthetic fabrics and shed
      its hairs. Moreover, mohair does not pill and is crease-proof, so it will look absolutely beautiful years after
      you bought it, even with heavy love and use.</p>
  <p>Therefore, with the proper care, an accessory made from this fibre will last you a lifetime.</p>
  <h3>Mohair blankets are extremely soft and silky</h3>
  <p>Mohair fibres, unlike other types of wool, don't have small protruding scales on their surface, which gives the
      material a very smooth finish. For this reason, mohair is blended with wool or alpaca to allow the fibre to stick
      together so it can be spun into yarn for weaving.</p>
  <p>Many mohair blankets will have a wool or alpaca base, through which the mohair is woven to produce a high, fluffy
      pile. This gives the home accessories the advantage of a little weight, the warming properties of wool or alpaca,
      and the soft and insulating qualities of the goat's wool.</p>
  <h3>Warming and lightweight, mohair blankets are great for winter and summer</h3>
  <p>The other advantage of this natural, lightweight fibre is that it's breathable, while still being insulating.
      That means that it will keep you toasty warm in the wintertime, but cool and comfortable in the summertime.</p>
  <p>The fibres are actually hollow, so similar to alpaca blankets, they retain your body heat better than other fibres.
      What's more, the fluffy pile traps additionally warm air around your body, so you'll feel enveloped in a
      cloud-like blanket of warmth.</p>
  <p>The breathable quality makes the material resistant to mites, and won't attract dust, which are two of the very
      negative effects of synthetic fibres. If you or a loved one is prone to allergies, mohair is a clever choice to
      have in the home.</p>
  <h2>Styling your mohair blanket</h2>
  <p>Blankets, throws and accessories made of this fibre catch and reflect the light, so possess a natural sheen and
      lustre that other wool homewares do not. This makes them ultra stylish, and beautiful statement accents in your
      living room and bedroom.</p>
  <p>Because the fibres absorb dyes extremely well, mohair blankets are often found in beautiful, bright, saturated
      colours. Pink, red, blues and turquoise are all brighter in mohair throws than in blankets made of other fibres.
      Yellow, mustard and mint, or deep, rich emerald green and silvery grey are all possible, too: so no matter what
      your favourite hue or the colour of your space, there's bound to be a mohair blanket that suits – and
      augments the style of – your room!</p>
  <h2>Mohair blankets for the living room & bedroom</h2>
  <p>Because these accessories display a natural lustre and feel silky to the touch, mohair is considered a luxury
      fibre. In the living room, a luxury blanket is perfect for adding a sumptuous accent to your sofa or an armchair.
      Drape one over the couch, and pair with matching mohair cushions for a polished and ultra stylish look.</p>
  <p>In the bedroom, opt for a mohair throw that complements the colour or your bedspread or bedroom décor for
      something that really stands out. If you have grey cotton bedding, for example, choose a colour that pops, like
      red or yellow. A mohair blanket is great as an extra layer because they are very warm – trapping the heat
      between the soft pile – but also very light, so you won't feel like you're weighed down. During the
      daytime, mohair accessories are perfect for using as a light throw for the knees when reading... hello, luxurious
      daybed!</p>
