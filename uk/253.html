  <h2>Wool Rugs</h2>
  <p>Rugs are a fantastic way to give a room a style lift and make your home feel more comfortable and cosy, especially
      when such a warm and natural fibre as wool is used. Simply by picking out a rug with a new fresh design, a bit of
      colour, or something that calms the senses, you’ve instantly got a piece that helps to pull together all
      your other home accessories. It can also group together pieces of furniture, and even provide you with more
      seating space, making the floor suddenly a little more attractive to sit on.</p>
  <p>But with dozens of types of rugs out there, it can be difficult to know which kinds of rugs you should be looking
      for (cotton, jute or a blend?), even before you consider colour and design! Whether you’re searching for a
      rug that’s suitable for your home, office, a playroom or practically any type of space, a wool rug is a
      solid option and URBANARA offers a wide range of both modern and more traditional styles. Durable, natural, soft
      and able to be woven and dyed into almost any type of pattern or finish, there’s rarely a wool rug that
      won’t do exactly the job you need it to.</p>
  <h2>What are the benefits of a wool rug ?</h2>
  <p>Naturally anti-static, a wool rug will help your home look and feel fresh, and is a great choice for people who
      suffer from allergies. Because wool doesn’t soil easily and is effective at concealing dirt, it’s a
      practical material for a ground covering, especially in parts of your home that are exposed to a lot of foot
      traffic. Bear in mind, however, if buying for a children's bedroom or playroom, a brighter colour is a safer
      option dirt-wise than a cream or white rug.</p>
  <p>Wool is flame retardant, but also soaks up airborne bacteria and odours in the home. Having wool rugs in your
      living room and bedroom will actually make your house safer and healthier to live in – so there’s no
      second guessing this fantastic floor material. Finally, wool is also a wonderful insulator against the cold, so
      can help reduce heating costs while keeping your rooms warm and your feet toasty. Because it’s a natural
      fibre, a wool rug will be better at regulating your temperature in the warmer months, so you’ll feel less
      uncomfortable on a woolen design in the summertime than if you had a synthetic one.</p>
  <p>Be mindful that wool rugs aren’t suitable for placing in the washing machine, while many cotton rugs are. If
      you’re after something that’s machine washable, or if you’re looking in particular for a kitchen
      rug, you may find that cotton runners are better for your needs, of which URBANARA has a large selection.</p>
  <h2>Which wool rugs are the best ?</h2>
  <p>The quality of the wool has a big impact on the overall design and finish of a rug. To achieve a long-lasting floor
      covering that’s durable and will still look beautiful after lots of use, high-quality, natural wool must be
      woven, thickly and tightly either by hand or machine, on a tapestry loom. Additionally, URBANARA sells arug
      underlay made in Germany from polyester fleece. The underlay is designed to stop your rug from slipping, as well
      as to keep both floor and wool rug (or other fibre rug) in great condition, prolonging its life.</p>
  <p>To produce high-quality wool, animals need to be well cared for. Prime wool is usually the first shearing from the
      season (sometimes referred to as new wool) and is taken from around the shoulders and neck of the animal. All
      URBANARA’s natural wool rugs are made using the best quality material and the finest grade fibres, generally
      with 100% pure wool. In addition to this, each and every one of URBANARA’s rugs is quality certified by an
      independent certification body to ensure that no child labour was used, and that each piece was made in fair and
      safe working conditions.</p>
  <p>Our partner suppliers, in addition, are experts in rug manufacturing. Many of URBANARA’s wool rugs are
      hand-loomed or tufted by local craftsmen and women.</p>
  <h2>What size wool rug should I buy ?</h2>
  <p>Wool rugs and runners are available in several sizes. Most common sizes are 140 x 200 cm, 160 x 230 cm, and 200 x
      300 cm. The smallest rug size is suitable for placing under a desk or in a small living space. In a kid’s
      room, this small size is suitable for placing at the foot of a single bed. They are also a good size if you want
      to layer your rugs for a cosy, eclectic look and add a modern and on-trend touch to your home.</p>
  <p>The largest rug is a suitable size for large, open, warehouse-style spaces, and will help segment or divide a
      room.</p>
  <p>Runners are typically 70 x 180 cm, which are the ideal size for placing at the side or foot of a bed or in the
      kitchen in front of a stove or your sink. The extra-long runners, usually measuring 80 x 250 cm, are designed to
      fit in a long corridor or hallway, or behind an oversized sofa, helping to divide a big room.</p>
  <h3>Custom wool rugs and extra large wool rugs</h3>
  <p>If you have a particular size in mind that is slightly larger or smaller than what’s readily available,
      URBANARA UK also offers customisation on many of our rug designs. To find out if your favourite rug is available
      to be customised, or if you’d like more information about our rug customisation service, simply contact us
      via our customer service team. They’ll also be able to give you a free quote and further information on
      which of our designs can be personalised.</p>
  <h2>Traditionnal wool rugs</h2>
  <p>Traditional designs are often available in wool because it’s a material that has been used for carpet weaving
      for centuries. Traditional rug designs are woven on a loom using a plain weave, or are tufted to produce a soft,
      lush pile. The higher the pile, the softer the rug will be. The majority of URBANARA wool rugs are made with 100%
      pure, natural wool for the ultimate in home luxury.</p>
  <p>Traditional wool rugs with Oriental and Aztec designs look beautiful against hardwood flooring and light coloured
      tiles. Pair a wool rug with floor cushions or a pouf for an interesting and alternative look. Often, traditional
      wool rugs have fringing too, which provide a tidy finishing touch to a classic style rug. A cream, white or grey
      wool rug holds a timeless style, keeping a traditional look to your room without a danger of the piece aging.</p>
  <h2>Modern wool rugs</h2>
  <p>A modern wool rug can help to bring a little warmth and softness to a contemporary interior. For a fun, modern
      look, select one with a bold geometric pattern or in a bright, playful shade. A bright green wool rug, for
      example, will give energy and life to a room that is in need of a kick.</p>
  <p>Modern rugs in more subdued colours, like grey, light blues or greens or a more natural colour such as cream or
      beige, are ideal for creating a calm atmosphere especially given the natural material used to make them. Just
      because a rug is neutral in colour, doesn’t mean it has to be boring: a chunky weave or patterned tuft can
      give a space depth and texture, helping to ad interest to a subdued colour scheme.</p>
  <h2>Matching your wool rug with other elements in your decor</h2>
  <p>While it’s very uncommon to find rugs that are available in sets with other home furnishings, it’s
      still a good idea to think about how your rug will fit in with the rest of your décor – indeed, a rug
      can be the decorative element that ties everything together</p>
  <p>If you’re decorating a whole room, it’s advisable to pick a rug you like first, particularly if
      it’s multi-coloured, then base the rest of your interior around it. Pick out a few shades to replicate in
      the rest of your furnishings or in other home accessories. For example, if your rug has shades of dark green or
      blue, you might like to select curtains in a similar hue to promote aesthetic harmony and balance.</p>
  <p>One last thing to keep in mind is the lighting in the room: you might find that the colours in your décor
      change slightly once your reading lamps ortable lamps are switched on (especially if you have warm light globes).
      Try to find something that will work with the ambience of your room. Grey, cream or white wool rugs usually stay
      faithful once it gets dark out.</p>
  <h3>Colourful wool rugs</h3>
  <p>If you’re looking for a new rug for a room that’s already decorated, start by identifying the colour
      palette in your room. Don’t forget to consider your sofa, the curtains, cushions and blankets and throws.
      Once you’ve understood your room’s colour palette, try to find a shade that compliments all or most of
      the colours.</p>
  <p>If you want a bright rug, for example, bright green, yellow, bright blue or another secondary colour, make sure
      that it won’t clash with the biggest piece in your room: the sofa. A bright blue couch paired with a bright
      blue rug will be very overwhelming. A grey or cream wool rug is a timeless and stylish option for a more Scandi or
      modern look, and will combined well with a grey or most other colour schemes in your room.</p>
  <h3>Patterned wool rugs</h3>
  <p>URBANARA rugs come in many different styles and patterns. If you pick a bold and bright geometric pattern and reuse
      this motif in a large proportion, such as in your curtains or wall papers, this might look overwhelming or too
      busy. This can be especially relevant if you pick a rug in more striking colour tones, for example an ocean blue
      or bright green rug. Instead, pick up the pattern in the form of smaller home accessories, like cushions, a piece
      of artwork, or sofa throws. Alternatively, URBANRA offers patterned rugs in more subtle tones, such as greys,
      whites and browns, especially using the size and thickness of the wool weave to create contrasting designs. This
      allows for an interesting statement piece but one which is not overwhelming and offers a more timeless pattern,
      such as seen in Scandi inspired designs.</p>
