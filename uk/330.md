## Which material duvet cover should I buy? 

Our range of duvet covers, made from silk, cotton or linen will bring elegance and comfort to any bedroom. 

### Natural linen duvet covers 

For those who prefer simple designs or a laidback look, our 100% linen duvet collections are the perfect solution with simple breathable fibres that enable you to sleep in comfort without forsaking style. [Linen bedding](https://www.urbanara.co.uk/bed-linen/linen-bedding) is not rough or stiff, rather it is textured and gets softer with every washing, while maintaining it's structure due to the high quality fibers used in the weave. 

### Cotton duvet covers  

All of our [cotton bed linen](https://www.urbanara.co.uk/bed-linen/cotton-bed-linen) is made with a high thread count and long staple cotton ensuring that they are long-lasting and of excellent quality. For more information on thread count, please see our buying guide. 

### Sumptuous silk quilt covers

For those who like the opulence of silk, we have a range of [silk bed linen](https://www.urbanara.co.uk/bed-linen/silk) and duvet covers that bring a real sense of luxury to any bedroom. As silk is also naturally hypoallergenic, it is resistant to mould and mildew and so keeps dust mites away - making it the perfect material for anyone with sensitive skin or allergies. 

## How to care for your duvet covers and bedding

For detailed washing instructions, check the label of each product. However with most of our duvet covers, except for those made of silk, we recommend washing them inside out and with similar colours at 40°C. If your washing machine has a spin speed setting this should be set at low.
