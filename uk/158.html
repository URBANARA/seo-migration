<p>Place mats and napkins are a simple way to dress up your dining room at
  a momentâ€™s notice. They work as easy accessories that will set the mood
  for a special meal or celebration and can also add a seasonal flair to
  your room. URBANARA has a large selection of place mats including striking
  retro-style designs and african-inspired prints as well as those with more
  subtle shades and patterns, ensuring there is something for all homes.
  You can purchase as many matching pieces as you need to make a set or mix
  and match different pieces to create your own look. Combine with some of
  our other table linen such as our table runners and napkins to create a
  truly beautiful dining table. Since place mats are small, it is easy to
  store them with other luxury linens for easy access when entertaining.
  Napkins add a sophisticated touch to any dinner party table and are also
  a more sustainable alternative to paper napkins. Like placemats, they work
  as a matching set or can be mixed and matched for a more cheerful look.
  All of our table linen is made with natural durable materials. Linen is
  robust, long-lasting and antibacterial, while high-quality cotton is soft
  and beautifully thick. This quality finish makes each piece perfect for
  entertaining guests. For more information on the properties of cotton and
  other materials that are used to make URBANARA products, please see our
  buying guide.</p>
