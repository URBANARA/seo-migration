 

When the days get darker and the temperature drops, it’s time to kit yourself out with a new cashmere hat or scarf.

Our high-quality woolly hats, scarves and accessories are made of the same finest fibres we use in our blankets, keeping you protected against the harsh elements outdoors.

Whether you opt for cashmere, alpaca or lambswool, all of our scarves, hats, gloves and slipper socks feel sumptuously soft against your skin and provide long lasting warmth and cosiness.

Made with wool from sheep, goats and alpacas, our soft hats and scarves will keep you truly warm this winter season.

Like our sumptuous cushions, our scarves and hats are made to the highest standards of international certification and contain only wool that has been stringently tested to ensure its quality and durability.

Designed in a selection of beautiful, natural colours, our winter accessory collections are designed to keep you looking great and feeling great during the dark winter months.

Urbanara always strives to bring you the world’s best textiles at the best prices and our hat and scarves are no different to our other collections such as our bedroom accessories.
