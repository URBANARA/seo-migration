  <h2>Find the perfect reading lamp</h2>
  <p>A reading lamp is more than just a functional accessory. For every room in the home, a combination of general, task
      and accent lighting is required, and a reading lamp can combine with the main lights and other spots to create a
      warm, inviting atmosphere.</p>
  <p>Available in a range of styles, colours, and sizes, there&rsquo;s sure to be the perfect reading lamp out there for
      your home. Choose between modern, contemporary designs made of steel, iron and other durable metals for an
      industrial, sleek look, or classic, traditional styles made from porcelain, wood and glass for timeless
      elegance.</p>
  <p>A reading lamp can work as a fantastic decorative feature in your home, even when it&rsquo;s switched off, so it
      pays to browse until you&rsquo;ve found the perfect one for your home.</p>

  <p>Now without further ado, here are a few things you should think about when selecting the perfect reading lamp
      online for your home.</p>
  <h2>What to look for in a reading lamp</h2>
  <p>When selecting your reading lamp, the first thing you should take into consideration is the maximum wattage of the
      bulb. A good strength is between 40 and 60 watts, which is slightly less than the wattage in the overhead lighting
      fixture. Because it&rsquo;s a specific task light, you should position it close to where you&rsquo;re going to be
      reading.</p>
  <h2>The best reading lamps for the bedroom</h2>
  <p>The best reading lamps for the bedroom are short table lamps that can fit on your bedside table, whose shade (at
      any point) is approximately forty centimetres from the top of the matrass. If you like reading lying down, you can
      get a style that sits slightly lower &ndash; but the bulb should always be concealed behind the shade in relation
      to your line of vision so that it doesn&rsquo;t create glare.</p>
  <p>Those who like contemporary bedrooms and minimalist interiors may prefer a lamp with a naked bulb, which can also
      work well when paired with a filament bulb.</p>
  <h2>The best reading lamps for the living room</h2>
  <p>If you&rsquo;re a little tight on space but love the idea of having a reading corner in your living room, a tall
      floor lamp is just the thing. Floor lamps, especially those with dual or double lights, are ideal because you can
      position the lower shade to focus on your reading material, while the second, higher lamp provides a gentle
      ambience for the remainder of the room. What&rsquo;s more, they don&rsquo;t require furniture to rest on, so you
      don&rsquo;t need a side table, keeping the room decluttered and free of unnecessary furniture.</p>
  <p>By placing an armchair or chair beneath an oversized floor lamp, it&rsquo;s easy to create a distinct space for
      reading: drape a blanket or throw over the chair and pile on a few scatter cushions for an incredibly comfortable
      but effective reading corner. With only two pieces of furniture, you&rsquo;ve just made a separate seating area in
      your living room, while still being economical with space.</p>
  <h2>The best reading lamps for the study</h2>
  <p>If you&rsquo;re using your reading strictly as a work or study aid (and it&rsquo;s not on your bedside table), your
      best option is a desk lamp, with an adjustable shade and a clean, bright, white light.</p>
  <p>White light is important for reading because it doesn&rsquo;t tire or strain your eyes. If you like warm, rich
      colours like mustard yellow, burgundy, brown and red, then choose a style that incorporates these colours on the
      frame, or on a completely opaque shade, rather than a textile shade. This is because the light that filters
      through the fabric will be tinted with the colour of the visor, and will make it hard on your eyes if reading for
      long periods.</p>
  <p>On the other hand, if you prefer to have no shade at all and like the look of a naked bulb, choose a filament
      lightbulb. They cast a warm glow without the glare, so you can look directly at them without squinting.</p>
  <h2>Last but not least, invest in quality</h2>
  <p>A good quality reading lamp is a real investment for your home, so make sure that it&rsquo;s made with the best
      materials available, and according to the highest manufacturing standards: make sure that your reading lamp has
      been tested with the maximum wattage, and that it has been produced according to the industry bodies that certify
      safe products. That way, you can be sure that your piece is a style investment that will brighten your room for
      years and years to come.</p>
