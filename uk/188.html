  <h2>Beach Towels</h2>
  <p>When summer arrives and thoughts turn to warm, lazy days at the spa, pool, and seaside, it’s time to consider
      indulging in a fine beach towel. A must for drying down, covering up, and keeping off the hot sand, one or several
      of these cute summer essentials belong in every savvy holiday maker’s beach or travel bag.</p>
  <h3>So what are the special qualities of beach towels?</h3>
  <p>Beach towels have to be highly absorbent and fast drying to do their job properly. Absorbency depends on the
      fabric, and cotton is the hands-down winner. Drying speed also hinges on thickness so beach towels are slimmer
      than regular <u>bath towels</u>. As a nice bonus, thin and lightweight beach towels are easy to fold up and slip
      into a beach bag.</p>
  <p>At the same time, beach towels have to be larger than their bathroom equivalents. Spread out on the sand, they need
      to be big enough to accommodate the largest frame. Lengths range from 150 up to 180 centimetres, and oversized
      beach towels are available for those seeking extra-large.</p>
  <p>Finally, the ideal beach towel simply has to look good. Summer demands style and the good news is that URBANARA
      offers a sumptuous range of luxury beach towels featuring exquisite designs that can light up a summer’s
      day.</p>
  <h2>Beach towels are made from which materials?</h2>
  <p>Beach towels are made from which materials?</p>
  <h3>Organic cotton for lightweight beach towels</h3>
  <p>Washable, elastic, breathable, durable, absorbent and above all, delightfully soft to the touch, organic cotton is
      the ultimate fabric for the dream beach towel. When it comes to absorbency, Egyptian and Turkish varieties score
      highly.</p>
  <h3>Terry Cloth</h3>

  <h3>Velour</h3>
  <p>Velour is a plush and lovely fabric crafted from cotton but with a smooth velvety feel, hence the name. It’s
      also an ideal material for patterning. However, it’s not as absorbent as some other materials.</p>
  <h3>Hybrid materials for synergy</h3>
  <p>Crafting beach towels using two fabrics delivers the qualities of both. One popular format features one side made
      from terry cloth for absorption, and the other from velour for its exquisite silky feel. Another emerging trend
      for modern beach towels is to have woven cotton on one side and terry cloth on the other.</p>
  <h2>Beach towels – how big are they?</h2>
  <p>Beach towels play various roles so they need to be large enough to hit all the spots. An average length of around
      180 centimetres allows most people to lie down without touching the sand.</p>
  <h3>Extra large beach towels</h3>
  <p>For larger users, jumbo models are available for maximum comfort and coverage. In addition, families looking to
      share a spot on the beach should choose size L or XL beach towels. These extra-large numbers measure up to 100
      centimetres or more in width which makes them ideal for picnic blankets for the beach.</p>
  <p>A generous size also help users stake out a space on the sands or by the pool and leave a roomy area to stash
      essentials such as sunglasses, sun cream, and the latest summer blockbuster.</p>
