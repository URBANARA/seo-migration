   <h2>Beautiful luxury blankets and throws for your home</h2>

  <p>Luxury throws and blankets make beautiful editions to your living or bedroom,
    providing you with a level of comfort, warmth and style that will make
    you love snuggling up and staying inside. Made of high-quality, rare natural
    materials, they’re a cut above the standard blanket, providing a level
    of warmth and softness that really is second to none. While mohair and
    alpaca make gorgeous luxury accessories, for a truly superior item, there
    is no looking past silk or cashmere, both of which are rare and labour
    intensive, requiring much skill to harvest and make into yarns.</p>
  <p>A luxury throw can really augment your living space and make it feel rich
    and exclusive – but you needn’t spend the earth when investing in a luxe
    piece: at URBANARA, we cut the middleman and only stock our own label items,
    so you always pay a fair price for quality products. That means that you
    have more to spend on other parts of your decor: many of our luxury collections
    also come with matching cushions, so you can complete the look and give
    your home a truly expensive feel for less.</p>
   <h2>What should I look for in a luxury throw?</h2>

  <p>When shopping online for a luxury throw, there are a few things that you
    should look out for. First is the type of material – or materials – that
    is used. Some ‘luxury’ items are cheaply made, woven with a mix of fine
    and common fibres. Pay heed to where the product was made, too; this will
    give you some insight into the quality of the fine fibre. Cashmere goats,
    for example, are native to Inner Mongolia in the northern part of China,
    so material or textiles that are woven there are of a superior quality.</p>
   <h2>Luxury blankets made from cashmere</h2>

  <p>If you’re shopping for a cashmere blanket, first have a look at the details
    section: do you want pure cashmere or a blend? A cashmere blend is also
    a gorgeous investment, but you should make sure that the second material
    is worthy of the mix, and that it is of a high grade. Wool, alpaca, and
    occasionally cotton are all blended with cashmere.</p>
  <p>If you are looking for a 100% pure cashmere throw, then the origin of
    the fibre is very important. Our entire range of cashmere blankets are
    sourced from Inner Mongolia. Due to the difficult and painstaking process
    of producing cashmere, only 150 grams of cashmere wool per goat can be
    garnered every year which means our cashmere blankets are high-quality,
    rare and truly luxurious.</p>
  <p>Moreover, the weavers in this part of the world have vast experience working
    with the delicate fabric, so you’re much more likely to get a throw that
    has been woven with care according to time-proven crafting techniques.</p>
   <h2>Alpaca wool luxury blankets</h2>

  <p>Alpacas, which are native to the Peruvian highlands, have very soft, warm
    wool that insulates them from the negative temperatures of the high-altitude
    climate. For this reason, 100% alpaca blankets are silky soft but incredibly
    warm – around six times warmer than sheep’s wool – but still very lightweight:
    completely luxurious and a joy to wrap up in on cold days. Because the
    wool is so soft, a luxury throw can double as a shawl or oversized scarf,
    and is comfortable to sleep under.</p>
  <p>URBANARA’s extensive range of alpaca accessories are made using only 100%
    baby alpaca fur, which is extra soft and silky. Woven in Peru by local
    weavers according to traditional manufacturing techniques, you can be sure
    that your alpaca blanket will pass the test of time, and continue to look
    simply stunning, season after season.</p>
  <p>Alpaca fur is naturally grey, brown or off white – and often are left
    undyed, the natural colour of the fur used to create natural textiles &
    accessories. This type of wool also takes well to dyes, however, so you’ll
    also find them in a wide range of colours.</p>
   <h2>Luxury wool blankets</h2>

  <p>Merino wool is shorn from the Merino sheep which is native to New Zealand
    and characterised by very soft, fine, curly wool. Blankets & throws made
    from merino wool are therefore incredibly soft, and free from the prickly
    or coarse quality that is found in other sheep wool. Merino wool has a
    smooth, weighty finish so will drape beautifully, making delicate folds.
    Because it’s smoother than standard wool, it won’t trap as much heat so
    it will be comfortable for use in both the cool and warm months. Draped
    over a sofa or the bed, textiles made of merino wool are really delightful:
    whether a chunky cable knit, a fine twill weave, or an intricate jacquard
    weave, a wool throw will add a stylish touch to your interior. The other
    advantage of merino wool is that it can be placed in the washing machine,
    making it the perfect accessory for everyday luxury.</p>
   <h2>Luxury throws made from mohair</h2>

  <p>Mohair blankets are luxurious because they are incredibly soft and silky,
    and possess a natural lustre that catches the light. In addition, mohair
    takes to dying very well, so they are often available in bright, vibrant,
    technicolour hues – meaning that they can be a seriously stylish and statement
    addition to your sofa or bed.</p>
  <p>When buying a luxury mohair throw online, look at what the base material
    is made of. Mohair derives from the Angora goat and is supremely soft with
    a fluffy finish, but requires a thicker yarn to be woven into. Our South
    African mohair suppliers weave the mohair with wool to provide beautiful
    blankets with excellent warmth and density – giving you the perfect amount
    of cosiness and comfort.</p>
   <h2>Choose a luxury blanket as gifts</h2>

  <p>No matter what their style or taste, there’s bound to be a luxury blanket
    to suit the most stylish of women and the most discerning of gents… and
    supremely soft and warm, there’s nothing quite like giving the gift of
    comfort. You can even have your gift delivered in a high-quality gift box,
    too – simply select this wrapping option at the checkout.</p>
