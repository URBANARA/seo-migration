  <h2>Kids' Rugs</h2>
  <p>When it comes to kids, creating bright, happy and healthy environments is our number one concern! Soft and
      comfortable underfoot, made of natural, healthy materials and bright, hard-wearing designs are the things that a
      kids’ rug needs for rest and play, and our collections really do deliver.</p>
  <h2>Colourful children’s rugs</h2>
  <p>Our range of bright, happy designs made from 100% natural materials are soft underfoot and create the perfect
      environment for your little ones to rest and play. From bold colours to positive, uplifting patterns to ones that
      are coloured to effectively concealing accidental spills, URBANARA’s range of kids’ rugs are fun and
      pretty (or pretty fun), but still timeless: so your little ones won’t outgrow them as they get older and
      their tastes change.</p>
  <p>That means that all of the rugs that are available for children would look equally at home in a play room as in a
      living room or in an adult’s bedroom, providing you’re up for a bright splash of colour and a fun
      pattern or design!</p>
  <p>Whichever design you go for, you’ll be investing in a rug that’s made using only the highest quality
      fabrics and materials. In fact, it’s a big part of what sets us apart from the rest: our collections of
      homewares and children’s accessories are made with quality in mind, so will last a lifetime.</p>
  <h2>Kids’ rugs: which material to choose?</h2>
  <p>Rugs can be made from many different fibres; below are a few that are good to use for a child’s room, and the
      benefits of each.</p>
  <h3>Cotton kids’ rugs</h3>
  <p>Cotton is a solid choice because it’s soft and smooth, available in many different designs, and is very easy
      to clean. Some <u>cotton rugs</u> can even be placed in the washing machine (which is what makes them particularly
      attractive as <u>kitchen rugs</u> too!).</p>
  <p>Cotton rugs are durable and are often reversible, meaning that their longevity is doubled: simply flip it from time
      to time and keep it looking beautiful.</p>
  <h3>Kids’ rugs made from wool</h3>
  <p><u>Wool rugs</u> can be woven in lots of different ways and, unlike cotton whose fibres are relatively fine, wool
      yarns can be thick and soft: making for very comfy floor coverings that are simply lovely to sit on. While wool
      rugs can’t be placed in the washing machine, this fabric is renowned for its ability to effectively conceal
      dirt and soiling… much better than other fabrics, in fact!</p>
  <p>It’s a really wonderful insulator, too, so if your home’s floors tend to be on the chilly side, a wool
      rug will make sure your little one doesn’t get cold feet if they’re wandering around without shoes or
      when they’re playing par terre… so they’re a good choice for a play mat.</p>
  <h2>100% jute children’s rugs</h2>
  <p>Jute is another common rug material, prized for its sustainability and malleability. It’s very soft to the
      touch, and is a 100% vegetable fibre: almost like vegan wool! Jute fibres too can be spun into thicker fibres than
      cotton, and this material is better suited for knotting and chunky designs, as well as smoother finishes which are
      more suitable for play mats.</p>
  <p>Jute, unlike wool, does not contain any lanolin and doesn’t have the scratchy or prickly quality that some
      find in sheep’s wool (<u>wool blankets</u>, for example, are typically more coarse than <u>alpaca
      blankets</u> or <u>cotton throws</u>). For this reason, <u>jute rugs</u> are ideal for children who have sensitive
      skin or who complain about wool’s ‘scratchy’ quality.</p>
  <h2>Rugs for boys</h2>
  <p>If you’re looking for a rug for your little boy’s room, think about how their rug will contribute to
      the rest of the room. For example, you could creating a nautical themed room with a blue and white striped design,
      or a sand-coloured floor covering. These designs are great because once your tot turns into a teen, the designs
      are timeless enough to pair with more ‘classic’ décor elements (or whatever strikes your
      son’s fancy on any given month). So they’ll be just as loved when your baby is 1 – 2, as it will
      be when he’s 3 – 4... Or even 10 – 12 and more.</p>
  <h2>Rugs for girls</h2>
  <p>Rugs for girls go well beyond ‘pink’ (though we think there’s merit in a pastel pink rug!). For
      your daughter’s room, why not consider more intricate geometric designs, a simple tribal motif in pastel
      shades, or something multi-coloured? Pick out some of the colours in your floor covering and replicate them in
      other parts of the room, like <u>blankets & throws</u> for the bed or matching <u>cushions</u> &
      <u>curtains</u>.</p>
  <p>Like for boys’ rugs, they work well in lots of different décor styles, so the rug will still work in
      the room even when your daughter’s tastes change.</p>
  <h2>Ethical and handmade rugs… that aren’t made by kids</h2>
  <p>At URBANARA, we think there’s something very wrong with the idea that many children’s accessories, be
      it rugs, kids’ bedding, toys & anything else they use, are made by children themselves. Every child has
      a right to happy and healthy childhood, free from underage forced labour. That’s why we will refuse to have
      our products made by any producer or manufacturer that uses child labour. When you buy a children’s rug
      online from URBANARA, you can be sure that you’re contributing to sustainable and fair work practices, and
      that no child suffered to make your child’s room beautiful.</p>
  <p>What’s more, the vast majority of URBANARA <u>rugs & runners</u> are independently certified by
      organisations vouching for their quality and honest workmanship, with many organisations, like GoodWeave and Care
      & Fair, actually re-investing into the communities where the rugs are made. Initiatives include education and
      sanitation programmes for children, so when buying you r child’s rug from us, you can feel good knowing that
      you’re helping make another child’s environment beautiful, too.</p>
  <p>We know that both kids and adults can be a little indecisive sometimes, and hey – it is hard to imagine
      exactly how a rug will look in your little one’s room. We do our best to take high-quality photos and give
      full and lengthy descriptions of all of our products so that you can make an informed decision about every
      purchase. But if for any reason you receive your rug and it isn’t exactly what you (or they) imagined what
      it would be, you can return it within 100 days, for free, no questions asked.</p>
  <h2>Free delivery for kids’ rugs to the UK mainland</h2>
  <p>We understand the importance of taking the hassle out of shopping, especially when kids are involved. When shopping
      around for kids’ rugs on the high street, it’s hard to take your time, compare prices, find something
      you all love, and lug it home (after walking all the way back to the car). The effort is nothing short of
      mammoth.</p>
  <p>When you buy kids’ rugs online from URBANARA, though, you get all the advantages of wide selection and best
      price, with the added convenience of it being delivered to your door for free, for all orders over £50.</p>
  <p>When creating our rug collections, we cut the middleman and go straight to the weavers in all corners of the globe.
      That allows us to ensure that each and every piece is made with love, by people who are experts in their trade,
      but also to lower the costs by going directly to the source: we then pass these savings onto you.</p>
