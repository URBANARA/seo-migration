		Table lamps for every room</h2>
	<p>
		No matter how immaculately styled a room is, it is simply incomplete without proper lighting. Stylish light fittings and lamps especially can elevate a room to levels that the most discerning of interior stylists would swoon over, creating the perfect atmosphere and style accent in your home. To achieve this level though, your lighting solution needs to go far beyond the ceiling pendant lamp: a floor lamp, plus beautiful, statement table lamps are all needed to make any room shine.</p>
	<h2>
		Why use table lamps?</h2>
	<p>
		Table lamps are important for creating a cosy, homely atmosphere. Together with general and accent lighting, they create a welcoming ambience by casting gentle pools of supplementary light that focus attention on the heart of the room.</p>
	<p>
		In addition, the function of a table lamp goes far beyond the light it provides: the right base and shade can tie in with other decorative elements of the room for a truly professional and polished look. Fancy Interior Magazine, eat your heart out!</p>
	<p>
		Aside from their aesthetic advantages, a table lamp often doubles as a task light, perfect for reading or other past-times, and so will become a trusted companion when you&rsquo;re spending time on the sofa or in bed.</p>
	<h2>
		What wattage table lamp should you buy?</h2>
	<p>
		Table lamps should contribute to the light in the room &ndash; not be the sole source. To ensure you&rsquo;re setting up a cosy space that won&rsquo;t strain your eyes, the bulb should be between 40 and 60 watts &ndash; lower than that of the ceiling light or a spotlight. This way, if you&rsquo;re using your table lamp to read by, you won&rsquo;t create glare, and you&rsquo;ll avoid a floodlight effect.</p>
	<h2>
		What kind of table lamp for which room?</h2>
	<h3>
		What kind of lamp shade?</h3>
	<p>
		A desk style lamp, designed so that the lampshade can be positioned over the centre line of a heavy base, is perfect for the study because it can be directed directly onto the task at hand and angled away for your eyes. A desk lamp will also compliment contemporary living rooms, adding an industrial edge.</p>
	<p>
		For focused light, select a design with opaque shades (metal is a good choice, but wood or very opaque glass &ndash; similar to ceramic &ndash; works too). This will allow you to direct the beam onto certain points in the room and will act as a spotlight or accent.</p>
	<p>
		For soft, diffused light, select a design that features a conical shade made from a semi-opaque material like cotton, linen, or paper. A shade in a different colour can make a vast and positive impact on the atmosphere. Table lamps with warm coloured shades: red, orange, yellow, brown or cream, for example, will cast a rich, warm light when they&rsquo;re on. Light grey, green, white, blue, black or other cool-coloured shades will create a different feel. Whichever colour you opt for, remember to consider the type of bulb you need, and the colour of the light you wish it to cast.</p>
	<h3>
		Table lamps with statement bases</h3>
	<p>
		It&rsquo;s not just the shade that contributes to the overall look and feel. After all, the light won&rsquo;t be switched on at all times, so it has to look the part in the day, too! Choosing a lamp base that complements the rest of your d&eacute;cor is imperative.</p>
	<p>
		A table lamp with a natural wood base will help warm a room even when it&rsquo;s switched off, thanks to the warming properties for which wood is renowned. A wooden design works particularly well in Scandinavian style homes, where ash, birch, and linden wood are a commonly occurring feature. They will suit more rustic interiors, too. If you are looking for a statement table lamp, opt for an oversized or sculptural design. This will make a style impact both in the day time and at night.</p>
	<p>
		Designs that leave the bulb exposed are typically more suited to contemporary interiors, and are the style you should go for if you love the artistic flair of a filament lightbulb.</p>
