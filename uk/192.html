  <h2>Silk bed linen: the ultimate everyday luxury</h2>
  <p>There&rsquo;s a reason that we use the word &lsquo;silky&rsquo; to describe something that&rsquo;s characterised by
      incredible softness and smoothness.</p>
  <p>Offering superior comfort and effortless style, silk bedding is widely considered to be the king of <u>bed
      linen</u> fabrics, possessing all the qualities that the adjective evokes.</p>
  <p>Smooth and soft, silk&rsquo;s appearance is truly special: unlike satin, which looks slightly glossy, this fibre
      possesses a natural lustre that gives the fabric depth and a rich, luxurious appearance. Despite its matt finish,
      the folds catch the light and make it look incredibly soft and inviting, and because it&rsquo;s so fine, it has a
      gorgeous drape.</p>
  <h2>Why choose silk bedding?</h2>
  <p>Aside from its gorgeous feel and naturally lustrous appearance, silk has a host of health benefits and practical
      advantages to other fabrics, depending on your sleeping requirements.</p>
  <p>First, silk is like linen bedding in that it is naturally hypoallergenic, making it a fantastic choice for people
      who suffer from allergies. The fineness and smoothness of silk (unlike linen) makes it difficult for dust mites to
      settle within its fibres, promoting easy breathing and a fresh, clean sleeping environment.</p>
  <p>Second, silk is unbelievably lightweight. Its airy, soft, cloud-like quality is absolutely dreamy to sleep in, and
      its slight static effect will hug your body, keeping you covered at an agreeable temperature all night long. Like
      linen duvet covers, this makes silk excellent for summer, but unlike linen duvet sets, it&#39;s a little more
      appropriate for winter.</p>
  <p>In fact, one of silk&rsquo;s most advantageous qualities is that it&rsquo;s one of the world&rsquo;s most
      insulating fibres compared to its own weight: known for its thermos-regulating properties, which help to regulate
      your temperature according to what your body needs, silk is a smart choice for couples who share a bed, but who
      have different sleeping needs. Like <u>wool blankets</u>, silk blankets and duvet covers are very absorbent,
      wicking moisture away from your body and helping to keep you warm when cold, and cool when it&rsquo;s hot.</p>
  <p>Its thin character makes it incredibly breathable too, so you&rsquo;ll sweat less, and unlike cotton, is a sensible
      choice for people who have very dry skin.</p>
  <p>For all the above reasons, silk bedding is often cited as a good option for people who have dermatological problems
      including very dry skin, acne, facial blemishes and congestion, or who are conscious of taking care of their
      collagen levels to slow the aging process.</p>
  <h2>High quality silk bed linen</h2>
  <p>Silk bedding is made from the natural fibres of the silk worm, which feed off the leaves of mulberry trees. Silk
      worms use these fibres to spin cocoons, so the characteristics of the fibre are durable, insulating, and
      comfortable (can we blame them?). Those same characteristics are apparent in silk fabric.</p>
  <p>There&rsquo;s a difference between high-quality silk and low grade fabrics however. It&rsquo;s possible to harvest
      silk without harming the worms, but it is sadly not always the case. In addition, silk farms are often treated
      with pesticides, leaving a large, toxic footprint on the environment.</p>
  <p>For URBANARA&rsquo;s silk bed linen, we use only the highest-grade silk available, made from mulberry silkworms
      &ndash; known to be the world&rsquo;s best &ndash; ensuring a quality finish. In addition, none of our silk
      bedding collections are &lsquo;cut&rsquo; or mixed with other fabrics, so when you buy silk bed linen from
      URBANARA, you can be sure you&rsquo;re investing in something that will last a lifetime.</p>
  <h2>Timeless silk designs</h2>
  <p>Silk fabric, like all other textiles, can be used to create a vast array of designs and styles; it takes to dye
      well and can be adorned just like cotton or linen bed linen. For our high-quality silk bedding collections, we
      opted for classic, timeless styles that represents true luxury that you can enjoy every day. We wanted to ensure
      that the quality of the fabric was at the fore, so there are no distracting embellishments. This makes our silk
      collections suitable for both men and women.</p>
  <h2>Styling your silk bed linen at home</h2>
  <p>Because all our designs are completely timeless, the possibilities to decorate your room are absolutely endless:
      classic, neutral-coloured or white bed linen makes the best of bases on which to layer your way to the bed of your
      dreams.</p>
  <p>Our neutral designs will work beautifully as a part of a traditional style bed, complementing more classic-style
      d&eacute;cor. Simply couple your duver covers with with a quilted bedspread or a neutral layer, like <u>blankets
      and throws</u>, lots of <u>cushions</u> with flanges, and a valance for timeless appeal.</p>
  <p>For something a little more contemporary, these designs will also pair perfectly with a geometric bedspread,
      patterned cushions and bright, bold <u>rugs and runners</u>: the sky&rsquo;s the limit to your imagination, and
      there&rsquo;s no space silk bedding won&rsquo;t work.</p>
  <p>The neutral styles also make it easy to change it up with the seasons, and because it keeps you warm in winter and
      cool in summer, it&rsquo;s a great choice for year-round comfort.</p>
  <h2>Affordable linens can be made from silk, too</h2>
  <p><u>Luxury bed linen</u> at an affordable price is hard to come by, so we made it our goal to source direct from the
      world&rsquo;s best silk weavers and develop collections in a range of styles, and sell them without the middleman,
      at a price that reflects their true cost.</p>
  <p>Our bedroom collections are available in all the popular sizes with the pillowcases and <u>duvet covers</u> sold
      separately, so you can mix and match your way to the most luxurious, comfortable bed ever, at a fraction of the
      cost of what you would pay on the high street.</p>
  <p>Investing in silk linen, while it is slightly pricier than other fabrics, is truly an investment. And because all
      our bedroom collections &ndash; from mattress protectors to duvet sets, scatter cushions to <u>bedspreads &amp;
      quilts</u> &ndash; are made to the highest quality standards, you can shop confidently knowing that you&rsquo;ll
      buy it once, and love it forever.</p>
  <h2>Silk bed linen: a high-quality alternative</h2>
  <p><u>Cotton bed linen</u> is often the default choice for most people, with <u>Egyptian Cotton Bed Linen</u> an
      extremely popular choice for those looking for something a little more luxurious.</p>
  <p>But there are excellent alternatives to Egyptian cotton for those looking for luxury bed linen: silk is certainly
      up there. Like Egyptian cotton, silk is a wonderfully durable fibre that, with proper care, will last a lifetime
      &ndash; no exaggeration.</p>
  <p>And while many assume that silk is too delicate to be machine-washed, this is simply not the case. Granted, it does
      require a gentle cycle and more frequent washing than cotton, but your silk bedding can be just as easily washed
      in the machine as other bed linen collections&hellip; and of course, sent to the dry cleaner&rsquo;s if you
      prefer! We recommend washing your silk bedding twice per week.</p>
