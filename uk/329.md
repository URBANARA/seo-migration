Our cotton quilts serve the dual purpose of adding an extra layer of warmth to your bed as well as the more decorative function of livening up any room. Our cotton quilts come in a variety of colours and styles including bold colours, striking geometric prints and unique patterns. Team with white sheets to add a splash of colour or combine with other bright designs to brighten up your bedroom. All of our cotton quilts are made with 100% cotton so are highly durable and easy to clean. We recommend washing our cotton quilts with similar colours at 40Â°C. As cotton is a very breathable fabric, all of our cotton quilts are soft and cool, making them the perfect layer on a bed during warmer months. Sufferers of allergies can enjoy more restful nights with cotton quilts as dust mites cannot penetrate highly woven cotton. For more information on the properties of cotton, see our buying guide. Our cotton quilts are available in both single and double size and many of our designs have matching cushions enabling you to instantly endow any piece of furniture with timeless style.
