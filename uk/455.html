		Floor Lamps</h2>
	<h2>
		Why choose a floor lamp?</h2>
	<p>
		Aside from being an (important) practical accessory, lighting, when selected well, can become a signature feature in your home. A floor lamp not only has the potential to transform the ambience of your room &ndash; literally at the flick of a switch &ndash; but to fortify the character of your d&eacute;cor and add style and statement to any space.</p>
	<p>
		Floor lamps come in all shapes and sizes, colours, materials, and are crafted for vastly different purposes &ndash; so taking the time to research which floor lamp you should buy pays off in the long run. Many interior designers swear by feature lighting and use this element to really up the ante in an interior. Fortunately, at URBANARA, you don&rsquo;t need to spend big for a designer-look; we craft all of our homewares directly with the producers and skip the middle man, so you never pay a premium price. What&rsquo;s more, all our lighting collections are made using the best quality materials, according to the highest standards, and with timelessness in mind. To make our floor lamps, we work with manufacturers who are experts in their field, and who are often the same manufacturers for luxury brands. So you know you&rsquo;re getting the best, without the sky-high price tag.</p>
	<h2>
		Floor lamps for a space-saving style solution</h2>
	<p>
		First of all, floor lamps are stand-alone pieces, meaning that they don&rsquo;t require an extra piece of furniture, like a coffee table or buffet, to rest on. This can help save precious space for small living areas or bedrooms, but also to help keep small surfaces clear and uncluttered. Neat surfaces with minimal ornamentation helps a room feel larger more airy.</p>
	<p>
		In addition, the space around the floor lamp &ndash; especially when it is switched on &ndash; is naturally divided from the rest of the room: place an armchair or vintage chair below it, and you&rsquo;ve instantly created an additional seating area, both elegant and functional, and without placing any natural dividers in the space.</p>
	<h2>
		Floor lamps add height to your room</h2>
	<p>
		A tall, oversized floor lamp will immediately add height to any room, which is a fool-proof way of creating a sense of space. Aside from their colour palette and the combination of furnishings, balanced interiors will always have a combination of short and tall pieces. And a tall lamp is just the thing to achieve this.</p>
	<p>
		It&rsquo;s not only in houses or apartments with high ceilings that this is important: the default &ldquo;design-move&rdquo; in a room with low ceilings is to select shorter pieces to distract attention from the fact. All this does is making your home look cramped and squashed. Instead, combine very short pieces with very tall pieces, and this will encourage the eye to move up and down, giving you the illusion of height.</p>
	<p>
		In rooms with very tall ceilings on the other hand &ndash; like period homes or loft apartments &ndash; the top half of the room can look bare and Alice in Wonderland-esque. Fill the upper space with a tall floor lamp that directs the light upwards. By doing so, you will give the impression of &lsquo;filling&rsquo; the empty space.</p>
	<h2>
		Which style floor lamp for your space?</h2>
	<h3>
		Tripod Floor Lamps</h3>
	<p>
		A classic tripod floor lamp is a great choice for a period space because they have a modern vintage quality and look just the part in an eclectic space. A three-legged lamp with a side-facing shade is reminiscent of the old film lighting used in the 1920s. But this design, thanks to the organic triangle motif in the tripod base, can also look very 1960s &ndash; so the style is incredibly impactful but also versatile.</p>
	<p>
		A tripod floor lamp is also the perfect addition to a Scandinavian-style home, especially one that features wooden legs. Topped with a simple white, black, or grey lampshade, place this style on a geometric rug or nearby a natural wood side table laden with green plants for instant Scandi style.</p>
	<p>
		While it should be said that these designs take up less space than single pole floor lamps, they are worth it because they make a huge style statement, and will undoubtedly add to the look and feel of your room.</p>
	<h3>
		Modern floor lamps</h3>
	<p>
		Modern floor lamps that look like oversized desk lamps ooze industrial appeal. For very contemporary living rooms, a metallic modern design can really look the part. Chrome and matt silver or black look more industrial, while a copper, gold or brass finish are still modern, but will afford your room a touch more glamour and warmth.</p>
	<p>
		When choosing a modern lamp for a contemporary space, remember to consider the bulb that you fit in it: for a sleek, modern, and cool space, soft gentle lighting makes the space inviting and liveable. Don&rsquo;t confuse contemporary d&eacute;cor for minimalist d&eacute;cor, though, which is simple but introduces warmth in the form of natural wood: While a minimal room requires cool white light, a contemporary space should incorporate warm light to give cosiness and to dispel starkness and sterility.</p>
	<p>
		Don&rsquo;t dismiss contemporary lamps as only suitable for modern interiors: a modern floor lamp can provide a fantastic contrast in eclectic homes, too. Paired with a rug with an African or Aztec motif, an old leather armchair and modern artwork, an industrial or bureau-style design can afford interesting style contrast.</p>
	<h3>
		Dual light or double light floor lamps</h3>
	<p>
		Generally, floor lamps with two lampshades make superb accent lights because they are wonderful for drawing attention to other features. Have a gorgeous piece of artwork, or a particularly stand-out piece of furniture? Position the shades towards the things you love to literally highlight your room&rsquo;s best features.</p>
	<p>
		If using as an accent lighting, select a dual-light floor lamp with an opaque shade. In metallic finishes like gold, brass, copper or matt black, it will be a feature all on its own.</p>
	<h3>
		Floor lamps with a wide lampshade</h3>
	<p>
		Because of the colours and patterns that you can find with lampshades, this type of lighting can completely change the look and feel of your space&hellip; both when it&rsquo;s on and off. A lampshade made of fabric &ndash; like linen, cotton &ndash; or of paper &ndash; will diffuse the light, helping it to cast a soft glow. Depending on the colour of the shade, you can control how warm and cosy your space feels: a red, yellow, orange or cream lampshade will cast a warm glow while a blue, green or light grey shade will cast a cooler light.</p>
