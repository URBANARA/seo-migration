  <h2>Throws made with love.</h2>
  <h2>Why use a throw?</h2>
  <p>Throws are a wonderful way to add a style accent in your home, while making your living space look and feel cosier
      and more inviting. Draped over a sofa, chair, or settee, a decorative throw in a bold, block colour or a geometric
      pattern can round off your interior look and easily and affordably pull together other elements in the room. More
      than just decoration, though, a beautiful, high-quality throw can help you and your guests feel at home and
      comfortable, providing a little extra warmth and comfort when you&rsquo;re cuddling up on the sofa or having a
      quiet night in. With dozens of designs made of high-quality, natural fibres to choose from, a decorative throw is
      a pretty and practical addition to any living room, no matter what the style or d&eacute;cor.</p>
  <h2>How to style throws</h2>
  <p>Styling throws in your house is an easy and effective way to give your living room a little lift and a bit of a
      pep. To sooth and calm the appearance of your room, opt for a blue or green throw. A throw in this colour works
      well if your room is south-facing, and has lots of direct sunlight. If your room is north-facing and you would
      like to up the warmth factor, a bright-coloured throw in red, orange, yellow or even pink will energise the space
      and give the room a pop of colour. Brown and tan or caramel colours are effective for injecting warmth into a
      space too, as they are the colour of wood, which is known to produce a warming effect. Neutral coloured throws,
      like cream, white, black, and grey especially will help to subdue loud and bold-coloured furniture. If you are
      looking for a very long-term investment, then a grey or cream throw is a good way to go, since they will go with
      almost any colour scheme. This little homeware accessory is also great for introducing new and interesting texture
      into your home. If you have a leather sofa, for example, a plaid or waffle weave throw can highlight the leather
      finish, and provide an unusual and interesting accent to the room. Conversely, a chunky knit or textured throw can
      jazz up a cotton-upholstered couch or armchair, and create attention-grabbing accents that give depth to your
      room.</p>
  <h2>Throws for beds</h2>
  <p>A throw can be used outside the living room too! In fact, a large throw (usually one that&rsquo;s over 140 x 170
      cm) can make a wonderfully stylish addition to your bed! Because your throw is going to be a different finish (and
      maybe a different material, too) from your duvet covers and bed linen, then it will instantly become a style
      statement. Throws with fringes are nice for the bed especially, and will be a welcome addition to your bedding for
      when you&rsquo;re using it as a day bed to read and relax. Plus, like a bedspread, a throw will help protect your
      bedding during the day (for when you need to sit on it, or if you live in a small studio apartment), ensuring your
      bed stays a clean sleeping environment.</p>
  <h2>Match with cushions &amp; curtains</h2>
  <p>Often, throws will be available to buy with matching cushions. Pairing your soft furnishings is a super easy but
      remarkably effective way of creating a professional interior, and a trick widely used by interior designers. In
      addition, choosing a throw that matches the hue of your curtains can do a lot for the &lsquo;completion&rsquo; of
      the room. While throws and curtains are rarely sold together (woollen curtains and knitted finishes aren&rsquo;t
      generally used for curtain panels), it is possible to match the colours. If you have patterned curtains or drapes
      in particular, pick out one of the brighter or bolder hues and use it as an accent for your throw: you&rsquo;ll be
      surprised how effective it looks!</p>
  <h2>Geometric throws with plain cushions</h2>
  <p>Because they are a relatively small home accessory, there&rsquo;s lots of room to be bold with pattern. Indian
      throws, which often use gorgeous blends of wool and silk, marry contrasting colours and employ interesting floral
      and geometric motifs. The pattern too could come in the form of the weave: jacquard weave throws frequently
      feature intricate designs that are repeated throughout the fabric, so you can often find waffle designs, chequered
      numbers, or herringbone finishes that are strongly formed in the fibre itself. If you select a geometric pattern
      throw, then it&rsquo;s a good idea to pair it with plain and block-coloured cushions of the same (or similar)
      hues. This will ensure you don&rsquo;t have a pattern clash, and that your couch won&rsquo;t overcome the senses
      and demand too much visual attention.</p>
  <h2>Throws and cushions: how to buy online</h2>
  <p>Buying matching cushions and throws online is very simple, once you&rsquo;ve decided on the type of material and
      style you want to go for. At URBANARA, all our products are clearly described, and for every purchase, includes
      free returns. That means you can easily and confidently select your homewares. There are a few rules of thumb for
      selecting accessories according to the season, and you should consider this before you buy throws online. Just
      because they are technically a blanket, doesn&rsquo;t mean that throws aren&rsquo;t great for your summer bedroom
      or living room! A Light throw in the summertime is a beautiful way to give your room a hint of extra comfort,
      without feeling that it&rsquo;s too warm. A throw can be pulled over your shoulders too for balmy summer nights,
      making it a versatile and useful accessory, no matter the occasion! Of course, heavier throws for winter are a
      singular comfort, and there really is nothing quite like wrapping up in one on a chilly winter&rsquo;s night. For
      the colder months, there are lots of suitable fibres which warm and keep you insulated. And after you&rsquo;ve
      decided what style you&rsquo;re after, think about the material you&rsquo;d like to have wrapped around your
      shoulders, and whether you want it to keep you cosy in winter time, or all year round.</p>
  <h2>Woollen throws</h2>
  <p>Woollen throws are a gorgeous, classic addition to any home. Sheep wool is ruggedly beautiful and charismatic, and
      is a much-loved natural fibre that has many benefits. Wool is a breathable, insulating fabric that keeps your warm
      while keeping you temperature regulated. Sheep wool is an incredibly durable and hard wearing material, perfect
      for a throw, which is often subjected to lots of handing and love: wool fibres have a natural elasticity that
      helps the material keep its shape. In addition, wool fibres can withstand being bent up to 20,000 times, while
      rayon can only be bent up to 75. Its hardiness and resistance to being stretched out of shape or tearing means
      that it can be washed at home on a gentle cycle, and doesn&rsquo;t need special cleaning treatment. Bonus! It can
      be spun into small or thick yarns that makes it suitable for both small, tight knits and also chunky, rustic
      weaves &ndash; so while wool generally feels the same against the skin, wool blankets can look very different,
      displaying a range of colours and patterns.</p>
  <h2>Cotton throws</h2>
  <p>Throws made of cotton are brilliant year-round accessories because they are light and provide a layer of
      insulation, without actively heating you up &ndash; ideal for both summer and winter. Summer throws are a simple
      and elegant addition to the home and help your living space feel cosy, without upping the heat factor: something
      you probably want to avoid. Cotton is also a smart choice for families with kids, because it&rsquo;s easy to wash,
      good for allergy sufferers, and is soft, so won&rsquo;t irritate young skin. Opt for a large cotton throw for your
      bed, too, for transitional seasons, when you require weightier bedclothes but don&rsquo;t need heavy
      insulation.</p>
  <h2>Alpaca throws</h2>
  <p>Throws made of alpaca wool make gorgeous and affordable gifts. They are characterised by a very soft texture
      &ndash; softer and less scratchy than sheep wool &ndash; but are nonetheless durable, and are less delicate than
      cashmere. An alpaca blanket is delightfully warm too, thanks to the special structure of the fibre: alpaca fibres
      are hollow, trapping the heat and maximising their insulating potential.</p>
  <h2>Monogramed and personalised throws</h2>
  <p>Throws make a fantastic gift for everyone &ndash; who doesn&rsquo;t love cosying up with a blanket? No matter what
      their taste, age, pastimes or style, a throw made of natural woven fibres will put a smile on their face.
      Sometimes though a very special occasion calls for a little something extra. URBANARA offers embroidery,
      monograms, and personalisation for all throws and blankets. Simply select your (or their) favourite collection,
      then decide what you&rsquo;d like to have embroidered on it to make it personal. Whether a logo, a date, or their
      initials, adding your own personal touch to a gift will make it truly memorable; simply get in touch with our
      friendly customer service team, stating the product you&rsquo;d like to have embroidered and the message or date
      you want, and they&rsquo;ll get back to you as soon as possible with more information.</p>
